## Mod 2 Deliverables:
Name of contact: Adam Carpenter

"09/20/2017"
(Outcome)

"He has not responded yet, I will follow up with him once more if I don't hear back within another day."

How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development?

"From what I have read about Adam, he and I have many of the same interests.  I feel like I can relate to him and it will
make it easier to make a connection.  He's a front end developer who succesfully completed the front end program here at Turing.  As an alumni I know that I can learn a lot from him."

Agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):

"The project management strategies that I used in my projects here at Turing were to constantly use testing as a part
of the project design process.  I laid out an initial design of what the project should be like and what I wanted to create and constantly restructured the project based on how the testing went and also taking into consideration that the app should be as user friendly as possible.  Taking testing into consideration greatly improved how my apps functioned and I will always
use testing as part of the design process in future projects and in my professional career as a front end developer."

## In-person feedback:

"The in person feedback took place on August 25th, 2017. My partner was Lola Brenner.
I prepared for the conversation by writing out a list of questions I have for Lola about what she thought
about our pairing experience.  I also wrote down things that I wanted to say to Lola.  I felt like this pre-planning
was very useful as I was able to say everything that I wanted to say, I didn't forget in the middle of the conversation.
The conversation went great, we learned a lot about each other and it was interesting to see her point of view of the experience and also to hear what she learned from pairing with me and how it would help her in future pairing sessions."

## Feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams:
"What I am doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator is that I am empathetic to my partner.  I adjust to their
learning style and strive to make sure that we both learn as much as possible and strive to make sure that our project is a success.

The biggest strength that I use is my ability to be empathetic.  I feel that the more that I understand my partner, the better that I can conform myself to be a better partner for them.

I will continue to develop my strengths by applying where ever I can.  Here at Turing and outside as well.  I feel that ever since I read my strengths finder, I was able to become more conscious of what my strengths are and now I am able to strengthen them through every experience that I face in my life.

As a teammate, I would like to improve by becoming a more encouraging indiviual.  I would like to be the type of person that if someone ever partners with me, they walk away from the experience feeling and knowing that they are amazing individuals who can accomplish anything and everything they want, here at Turing and in life!

I would like my teammate to see me as a person of value.  I'd like to be the type of person that can inspire others and can help them whenever they seek out help from me."
