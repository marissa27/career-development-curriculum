## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing? 
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    * What was effective?
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)
* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)
* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md)

I was mostly just following the project specifications and advice from my instructors. Turns out that's pretty close to the agile develpment process. Start with a small module of of the scope project. Get the requirements, mock up design with a variety of targeted users in mind, write the code, test to ensure it works as intended, and use the notes and lessons learned during that loop to inform the strategy for the next module of the project. I didn't really put anything else in place during mod2 as I was already doing agile development just following the propject guidlines and advise from instructors. I did however become more aware of how was already using agile develepment and that heightened awareness helped me break down the strategies. I want to actually write down each step of the process for my future process. Help with notes and the next sprint. 

In pair projects, I kept things organized. I would strategize our overall project path and how to solve individual problems. I kept open communications with my teammates and listened to their input. If we were struggling, I would implement time-box solutions and reach out to my support structure. I loved to handle the nitty gritty problems of logic we encounter in our first dives into these new frameworks. 

Julie and I had a nice conversation. I didn't really prep too much for it other than reviewing my notes from the project and the eval. She gave me some good coaching about getting started earlier and asking for help earlier in order to avoid the dreaded pressure cooker of the last day desperation coding. I had been in a rough spot during out project and Julie did a great job keeping our project afloat and keeping the mood positive. I let her know how much I appreciated her using her personal strengths as an empathetic person, implementing that mindset for the user, and for her teammate. I gave her some coaching to remind her that code is cheap, and can and should be rewritten. I let her know that I look forward to pairing with her again.

As a young boy, I never had a sense of what I wanted to be when I grew up. My proclivity to break things in order understand what made them work led many to suggest I would be interested in engineering. I loved math and science, breaking and building, so why not? I'll tell you why not. Because the American Educational System is trash, and drugs can be way more interesting to a clinicly depressed twenty year old. But after working menial jobs for menial pay, bouncing from one to the next, I decided I needed to aquire a real skill. A skill that would not only benefit me and my personal future, but a skill that I could use to possible make a positive impact on the future of our planet. A friend suggested I checkout coding, and I got hooked. Three months later and I'm on my way to being a Programmer!

I plan to attend a few networking events and not just sit in the corner eating the food and drinking water. I will talk to another human, maybe two. I hope to meet someone I can have as a friend, not just a network asset. Someone I can text/call with personal and profesional issues. Also, I will begin my warm and cold outreach looking for more mentors during the break. I have mentors, but I already knew them going in to Turing and I need to have more people in my Rolodex. I hope to find someone into snowboarding/skateboarding because, shared interest, but simply gaining friends would be nice. I need more friends. At least that's what my Mom tells me. I still haven't drafted a good outreach template yet, but it is in the works.
