* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews:  
  * Be there on time: not too early and definitely not late!!!  
  * Try to be relaxed, do something relaxing right before the interview  
  * In this industry the purpose of the technical interviews is to determine the limit of the applicants capabilities. It is expected in most cases at least reach a point where the application doesn't know the answer
  * It is a great idea to send a follow up of a a completed or refactored version of the technical challenge that was covered during the interview  
  * Come prepared not only about technical details and not only how to present about personal background, but be prepared about the company as well
