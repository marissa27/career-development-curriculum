* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews:
1. There are no rules: whether I nail the technical challenge or not, I can work on the problem later, be communicative during the challenge, and be responsive to criticism in order to turn a not-so-great interview into an offer.
2. Don't ask for a burrito
3. Try to recognize if the technical questions are a part of what I'm really expected to know, or if they're just trying to stump me.
4. It's better to be open about not knowing something than to be caught in BS.
