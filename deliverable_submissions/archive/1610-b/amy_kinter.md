## Mod 4 Deliverables:
* Link to overview of 6 Cold Outreach emails following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md):
* Link to your completed Turing portfolio, complete with your name, photo, description, 3 projects, and resume:
* Summary of participation in practice interview and/or actual interview using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_practice_reflection_guidelines.md)

OPTIONAL (You'll need to complete this plan to submit to Meg for post-grad job search support, but you do not need to submit it for your Mod 4 deliverables):
* Link to completed action plan for the post-grad job search using this [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md). 

## Mod 3 Deliverables:

* Link to completed [Flower Exercise](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf): I have to attach a PDF of this, as I filled it out by hand. Here is the PDF of my flower exercise: https://turingschool.slack.com/messages/@megstew/
* Link to Turing Alumni Profile: https://www.turing.io/alumni/amy-kintner
* Job search action plan for M4: I have already applied to a variety of companies and had some degree of success (one technical interview, two chats with hiring managers). I am trying to do three applications a week at this point and will continue with this. I am also working to reach out more to people I've met at job fairs or meet-ups and network with them, though I admit I didn't get much of this done in Mod 3. Moving forward, I will do two cold outreach emails per week and keep up the applications at the pace I'm going now. 
* Link to Trello board: https://trello.com/b/6RPBJrUa/amy-kintner-job-tracker-wishlist
* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: The basics I've gathered so far from my experience: show up on time, but not too early; speak to what you know and don't exaggerate skill sets you aren't ready to back up in a technical interview; be receptive to criticism in technical interview and accept it gladly; ask questions about the company and come prepared with some specifics; be careful about asking questions that have to do with work-life balance, as they're off-putting to some people; know what questions are off-limits and don't ask those/be aware if they're asked of you; DO have an answer to the question of how much you're looking to get for a first salary (I like Jeff's idea of a baseline, an amount that would be totally acceptable, and an amount that makes you excited).
