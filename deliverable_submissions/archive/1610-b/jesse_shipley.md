* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: 
 - Be yourself! Show up on time, not early.. definitely not late.
  - Ask questions that are specific and meaningful to the reasons you are at the interview;
    - This would show you have put thought into the job, and possibly researched the company.
  - Definitely research the company.
 - Prepare yourself with a mental warm up, brain stretches.
 - Remember that you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you;
 - Be nice to everyone you encounter at the company, its not just the manager who could make the decision
 - Don't be afraid to say you dont know during a technical session
  - If you get stuck or don't finish, take the problem home, finish and follow up with your end result and what you learned
