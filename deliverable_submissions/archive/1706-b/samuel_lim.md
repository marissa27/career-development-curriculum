  # Agile Practices
  
  This mod really benefited me in developing my workflow skills in both git, project management, and social interactions as well. Working with a team is FAR different than working along or even with a partner. There needs to be team dynamics, and you have to work well together. Working with agile idealistics means this is that much more achievable

* How did you prepare for the conversation?

I reflected mentally over the pros and cons of working with the people I worked with.

The conversation went very well. All three of my group members had the dynamic down and worked fluidly together.

We were very careful not to use any violent communication, and focused on strengths and where we needed to improve.

I need to work on not cutting people off when they're talking!
