* Practice interview:
  I have participated in three remote mock interviews with Ian Douglas, Growth Hacker at GetStream.io. We have gone over high- level questions, logic problems and lots of Ruby exercises in these interviews, and Ian has been really instrumental in helping me deal with coding in front of others and talking about myself.
