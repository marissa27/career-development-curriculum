### Summary of participation in a actual interview or practice interview that includes details of the company, interviewerâ€™s name, and their title:
Andrew CTO Precision Hawk.
I emailed Andrew at precision hawk. He responded within the hour email me back saying he'd like to a phone call but to have my computer on hand. We ended up connect on a friday and he had me login into a website where we could share a console. I considered telling him about screenhero but didnt want to sound over confident. He had me work through a few problems with reversing strings and counting every even number to a 100. Then we made an array of the fibonnacci sequence. I really stuggelled with the fib sequence. I floundered on it pretty hard, with him eventually walking me through it. It was extra frustrating because we'd done it a week prior. I stayed in a good mood through out and it asked a lot of questions. He said it was positive because really he wanted to see how i problem solved more then see me solve the fibonacci sequence. We talked for another hour or so with him finally signing off and telling me to follow up with him.
