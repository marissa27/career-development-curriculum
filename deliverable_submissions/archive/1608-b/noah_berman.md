* Summary of participation in a actual interview or practice interview that includes details of the company, interviewerâ€™s name, and their title: 

I interviewed with Alan Brockett and Neeraj Khadakkar at CA Technologies. They are both dev managers (one for backend java, the other for frontend). This was an 'actual interview.' It was an over-the-phone technical challenge and I asked plenty of questions, offered to test (it wasn't possible on the platform we were using) and managed to do pretty well on the first half of the challenge. I stumbled on the second half and wound up going in circles for a while. I just wasn't thinking about the problem the right way and forgot about some techniques I needed. 

We had a good if quick conversation after they called time -- as CA/Rally Central is a small part of a much larger company I was interested to hear how that relationship affected their work. I ultimately did not get asked in for a second interview but had some really good feedback from the recruiter -- here are my notes from the follow up call: "Personable, good communicator, pt 1 right away, struggled on pt 2. On plus side: instinct was to write tests, use repl, but would need a decent amount of mentoring." I kind of figured that might be the case (it was a "jack of all trades" kind of position) but still a good practice/learning experience. Plus, always good to get that first one out of the way.
