### Cold Outreach

##### MakeMusic

* Marco Herrera Rendon, Software Developer

* Emailed on 1/26/2017

##### TrainHeroic

* Aryn Crowley, Director of Engineering

* Emailed on 2/5/17

* I also applied for this position, so his response was actual an email stating that my experience didn't match what they're currently looking for.

##### TrainingPeaks

* Bernardo Fanti, VP of Engineering

* Emailed on 2/6/17

* I emailed a question about his blog, but he never responded. I also applied for a position at this company and never heard back. I'm not sure if I'll follow up or not.

##### ChromaticFM

* Nathan Bergey,

* Emailed on 2/7/17

* I didn't hear back from him, but I also applied for a position here and got a "no" back from them. I'll take that as a response.

### The Plan

Not yet completed

### Technical Interview

I had a practice interview with Ian Douglas. I need to get better at breaking down large problems into smaller components. Psuedo code helps. I also had a practice interview with my mentor, Casey Gipson. I learned to better explain past projects and differences between SQL and ActiveRecord.
