## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing?
    I've tried to be agile in my approach toward my learning style by trying out several different methods of absorbing information. By trying several different note taking styles, I have figured out what works best for me.
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    In Mod2, I started to utilize outside resources like mentors.
    * What was effective?
    Hearing others' perspectives helped me to build a more complete image of some of the more challenging concepts.
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
    I want to continue to work on reaching out to various resources and expanding my network.
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
  In my paired projects, I tried to play more of a supporting role and work on stepping away from the keyboard. Whereas in Mod1, I always wanted to drive and direct the situation, I've been trying to work on utilizing some of my leadership strengths to create a better team dynamic where everyone feels valued.
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines]
Date of feedback conversation:
10-12-2017
How did you prepare for the conversation?
I tried to prepare what I would say in regards to feedback for my teammates so I could guage the way it might be received.
How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
It was a really positive and honest conversation. We were able to read each others' tones and adjust the conversation accordingly, which made it easier. It was difficult to give criticism, but it probably come off as more sensitive in person.
What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
We all gave both positive and coaching feedback.
* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)
I found myself at MSU at 18 years old without a plan.
I wasn’t entirely sure of my interests and the thought of four more years of school was enough to induce a headache.
I bounced around for the first few years- chemistry, polysci, prelaw. I felt like no matter what I did, I was wrestling with the material. I finally landed on accounting, which although it wasn’t perfect, taught me how to love learning. It also showed me that I am a strategic thinker and enjoy being challenged.
But something was still missing. Accounting lacked the creativity I was subconsciously searching for. Half way through the junior year, I began studying advertising management. I found the difference between the two programs to be this: the accounting degree was far more intensive. It was a full-time commitment. Advertising management was a similar study to marketing, but less intensive. However, this afforded me the opportunity to develop my interests and gain experience outside of the classroom.
I left for Australia in July of my last year of college. I took fashion sustainability courses at QUT, where I identified a problem that I grew to care greatly about. I saw technology as a potential solution, and I began researching ways to get involved immediately. As I've progressed through Turing, I keep this in the back of my mind and am excited to continue to develop a skillset that will hopefully someday help me accomplish this goal.
* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines]
Why will you attend this particular event?
I plan on attending a Women Who Code meetup within the next mod. I think it will be important to make female contacts who have navigated the industry and faced adversary based on their gender.
Who do you hope to connect with at this event?
I hope to connect with women who could potentially become mentors.
How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?
I will make sure to ask for their contact information when I meet them and follow up with an email within the following few days.
