## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing?
      * I was already using waffle as a tool for working in projects with other developers.
      * We were already doing two weeks sprints.
      * We were modifying our code according to the feedback given.

    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
      * In Module two I managed to practice what working on a team of four feels like. Also how to keep a good
      workflow.

    * What was effective?
      * Using Waffle and using git correctly was really effective.

    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
      * I will like to improve on adding more comment on my pull requests.

  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
    * In this module, I play a support role. I will pick up the things that my team left and I will
    help them whenever they got stuck in a project.

* Feedback II reflection:
  * Date of feedback conversation: October, 20, 2017

  * How did you prepare for the conversation?
   * We did it right after the eval so everything was fresh and we could have a discussion about what went righ.

  * How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
   * The conversation was pretty smooth. Everything went well and I got constructive feedback. We all were in the same page.

  * What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
    * We used coaching and point out the good things.


* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)
    My interest in Tech goes back about 6 years ago when I was playing soccer internationally. I found myself
    in my computer a lot while traveling, on the airplane, and even in the hotel rooms while my teammates where doing their own thing. Being captain of a great team and what many people will consider a professional team has give me the determination to learn anything that I set my mind too. Needless to say that my ability to grow and improve is self motivated.

    Now that I am in the tech scene, I will put in practice what I really do know how to do. That is work hard, try to be the best version of myself, and by doing that I will impact the people that surround me in a positive manner. I always have big expectations for myself, that is why I join Turing to learn the backend side of programming. I have been learning Ruby on Rails and it has been quite an amazing experience. I did not just pick up the basic of Ruby and Rails, but I now understand the basic of OOP.


* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3:

  * Why will you attend this particular event?
    * I will attend Railsbridge: Ruby on Rails workshop -- Winter 2017 and hope to
    connect with developers.
  * Who do you hope to connect with at this event?
    * I will like to connect with companies and other developers.

  * How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?
    * I will ask for a business card and give them mine.

  * Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about
    * I will like to connect Torie Joy-Warren and Susi Irwin because, I will like to know more about the
    Seattle and Denver tech scene.

  * When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet
    * I will contact them ASAP and try to meet before module 3 starts.

  * What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them
   * I will definitely keep talking to them and get them to guide me through the best path.
