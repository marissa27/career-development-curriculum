## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing?
    Utilizing waffle as a project management tool, having daily standup meetings with project partners, utilizing slack for ultra quick and never ending communication, being especially empathetic and communicative during the project lifecycle.
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    I did not implement any further tools. We continued to have daily standup meetings and very frequent checkins while in a paired project work environment. When working on projects alone, I implemented waffle to keep myself on track and on time. Always iterating always improving.
    * What was effective?
    It was all super effective. I feel as though communication is a matter of the utmost importance and so I tried to be extra communicative and honest with my project partners as well as with myself. 
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
  I feel as though I acted as a team lead most of the time, tempering group tensions and keeping us on track. When I wasn't operating in a leading role, I acted as a techinically focused team member and contributing as much as humanly possible in terms of code. I utilized my skills as a strategist to guide the team in a positive direction. 
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)
Date of feedback conversation: Immediately POST bike-share evals.
How did you prepare for the conversation? I didn't prepare at all. I think these conversations need to be organic and need to flow accordingly. 
How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
The conversation went excellently. My team was open and empathetic. Communicative and honest. Courageous and focused. Our conversation went swimmingly and feedback flowed 
What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
We spoke to eachother honestly and directly. We made sure to operate under the non violent communication framework and kept our feedback actionable specific and kind.

* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)
I have worn many coats, professionally. I have worked with a team of arborists, cutting down trees in the jungle, I have worked in the NGO space in Central America, the South Pacific, and in The Indian Ocean, I have acted as an entreprenuer, a law clerk, I have been a professional photographer, a caretaker, I have conducted research as a post graduate student at the University of Miami, I have been a grantwriter, I have hand built surfboards, and etcetera. I tried to ascertain what it was that drew me to all of these vastly different and seemingly unrelated fields and I came to the conclusion that they all required a certain level of risk, creativity, and independence. I wanted to find a field of work that would mesh well with my personality type. One that allowed me to unleash my creativity and one that allowed me to solve ultra complex problems in a way that would help as most people as possible. I think I have found the perfect occupation.

* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md)

Meetups - I am active in the meetup space and try to attend as many as I can, given my scheduling constraints. One that i've been meaning to check out is boulder python. I want to learn Python and I want to meet cool people in the space and so I will make the time to head up to boulder and see whats really goin on.
Warm Outreach - I am constanly reaching out to people in the Denver area for advice as it pertains to learning new technologies and have had several successful coffee meetings with professionals from innumerable cool companies. I will continue to employ this strategy, reaching out often and planning meetups accordingly.
