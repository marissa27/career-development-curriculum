  ## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing?
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    * What was effective?
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?

At the end of module 1 and during module 2 using agile processes to complete projects has been crucial.  In my teams we have used waffle to quickly organize tasks into small manageable chunks that address a specific point of functionality. Waffle has been great for prioritizing tasks and changing their order of importance in real time depending on how the project is going.

Already before on teams we would always work in iterations when taking on a large project. This way as a group we were able to create a minimum viable code base. By having something up and running early on we were able to better understand the project as a whole. This strategy helped when trying to later understand more complicated parts of the project as we had a working base.

Using waffle was a great way to divide up the work into chunks that were more manageable to tackle. Sometimes it would cause issues if someone built out a feature that would ‘talk’ to another feature someone else had created. 

For future projects I would like to improve the speed of the feedback loop. Currently we tend to build out the entire project and then submit it to the instructors to review. Often this is too late and instead it would be great to show work to instructors iteratively so we can quickly build out their suggestions. 



  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

  As a teammate I used my learning skill to make sure everyone was always understanding the various aspects of the project. Using my skill in empathy I was always aware to be understanding when someone on my team did not understand something fully. With my background as a UI designer I was always keen to talk about design and talk about different styling ideas with the rest of my team and how the industry would interpret these. 



* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

Date of feedback conversation: 
07/12/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? 
Thought through how the project had gone for us as a team and made a mental map of the topics I would like to discuss in the reflection. 
How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
The conversation went really well. I had a great group for this project and everyone worked well together. It was an easy conversation to have as this group have very similar personality types and so find it easy to stay on the ‘same page’. We talked about how everyone was able to bring a particular strength they had to the project. However, we did feel that next time we should swap roles a bit more i.e. people who feel strong on a particular thing should actually try building out parts of the project they were not comfortable with. 

It was difficult to talk about our GitHub issues we ran into. We often blamed GitHub for behaving strangely when things go wrong instead of addressing the underlying problem.  The truth is as a team we have a primitive understanding of how the system actually work, yet no body wants to admit this. 

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? 
Coaching, appreciating and sincerity.

* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)

Growing up the youngest of three sibling’s technology was always my obsession. My brother would tinker around with Legos in the basement, my sister with water paints in the lounge and I with the latest ‘fad’ gadget on the lawn. As I grew so did my love of all things computerized. For me technology had the power to challenge the status quo, to create entire industries and sometimes destroy them overnight, I was hooked. 

After University I landed a job with a large European investment bank to help design web platforms for their core business. This was a great role and allowed me to blend my interests in behavioral economics and technology together. I learnt loads about the entire UI/UX process and really enjoyed designing systems that improved how FX traders interacted with the bank. However, I wasn’t satisfied with just designing these applications. I wanted to know what was really going on behind the scenes. Why did certain features take months to implement? While others could be done in a matter of days. Why were some designs beyond scope? While other designs already had the data we needed. All this led me to take up web development in my spare time. I wanted to know more and this eventually led to me Turing and now the rest is history. 



* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md)

Meetup: Denver UX

•	Why will you attend this particular event?

Having worked in the UX/UI industry before I know many of the people here will work closely with developers in the companies they work at. It will be a great way to know which industries in Denver are currently looking for junior roles. I know that as a UX/UI designer working with a developer that has an understanding of the things you do is a dream and can make the working relationship so much better. I think when people at the Meetup learn about my background there will be an incentive for them to recommend me for roles. I also think targeting this community is strategic as may other Bootcamp grads will be chasing potential jobs at the developer specific meetups. 

•	Who do you hope to connect with at this event?

UI/UX designers that work closely with developers and want someone to join their team who has a background in both. Also any new start up founders that are looking for someone to design their application and also build it out. 

•	How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?

Invite that person out for coffee to lean more about them. What do they like about the company they are working in. What advice they have for someone who is trying to get into the industry. 
Warm Outreach: Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it! Describe:
Warm Outreach Person: Benjamin Jacobs

•	Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about

Ben has been my mentor since module one. He knows my working style and I have got to know him well over the weekly paring sessions we have had. I hope to talk to him about his tips for landing a job out of Turing. What things to work on so I succeed in a technical interview as well as what things I need to brush up on with my coding in order to do well in a first job.  

•	When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet

I will contact them by week 3 of module 3. We will meet at Turing and go grab a coffee at one of the local places. 

•	What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them
Thank him for his time. Mention a particular piece of advice that he gave me that I found really useful and talk about my game plan going forward.
