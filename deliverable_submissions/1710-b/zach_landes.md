Mod 2 Deliverables:
Written reflection:
How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
What were you already doing?

By being at Turing I was already using some agile processes. Like the project iteration concept, and also pomodoros, retros, and DTRs.

What did you put into place in Module Two?

I started using waffle boards and having standups with groups. In Mod 2 we really started utilizing some of the agile processes connected to team based projects.

What was effective?

tasl management tools were super effective. As are standups and retros.

What do you want to improve on in future projects?

It would be good to take more of a team management role in the future, really owning some of those agile processes.

Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module --

what was your role as a teammate? For bike share, I took on more of a guiding role, managing git and also driving the project. For little shop, I'm definitely working under Max's guidance, which has me learning tons.


 How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

For bike share I definitely used my communication skills and WOO skills to develop ideas and work through road blocks. Also used my compassion to make sure every one was being heard.

Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these guidelines


Date of feedback conversation:
12/7/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation?
  I just thought about how it all went and what all of our roles were.

How did the conversation go for you?

It was great, I had a really great team.

 What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

we get a long really well, so the conversation was really easy. There wasn't anything particularly difficult about the conversation, though we had challenges as a team getting through the project.


What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

Professional Story --

I've always had an affinity for how large systems work and how society does, or doesn't function. I want to impact that large social organism so that it helps the most people most of the time. At university I studied political science and worked for city governments like santa cruz, winters and san francisco. I like the city because it is a real, tangible example of the hugeness of our society, and impacts at the local level can be seen and grasped.At San Francisco,  I worked for the office of workforce development which helps small businesses hire people and later moved to a community development non profit to support business in the SF Bay Area. We managed the Americorps program which provided support to low income neighborhoods.

I was still passionate about the cause but I sought to gain new skills outside of the non profit world. As climate change was gaining awareness, I looked to renewable energy as a way to make a powerful impact on the health of the planet. I got certified as an installer and worked as a field surveyor and designer of solar systems. I took a real liking for design and gained exposure to tech and the startup world here. At Sungevity, I worked with some software engineers who encouraged me to pursue development for social good.



Meetups/Networking Events: Identify 1 meetup and/or other networking event that you'll attend between now and the end of Module 3. Answer these questions:

Python meetup Denver

Why will you attend this particular event?

I'm really interested in Python and my mentor mostly uses it.

Who do you hope to connect with at this event?

Maybe some people who have jobs to give me .

How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?

I'll write them and keep in touch if it seems like things are going well.

Warm Outreach: Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it! Describe:

I'm  going to reach out to my developer friend Sam who is a senior dev at Uber.

Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about,

I really want to get insight into technical interview questions, also just about developer life in general.

When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet

He lives in Oakland, CA, so I'll try to reach him online over a weekend sometime in mod 3.


What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.

Just thanking him and setting up a time to meet again.
