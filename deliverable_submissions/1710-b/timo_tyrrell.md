##Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
    * What were you already doing?
    I was already using waffel and communicating effectively with slack.
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    In module 2 I started utilizing screen hero more and dedicated more time to in-person work. The in-person setting certainly has been the best for progress. 
    * What was effective?
    Screen Hero was an effective tool for communicative purposes. It helped me explain exactly what I had done in the codebase, and allowed for effective communication in a remote setting. However, becoming more comfortable working together but on separate branches was somehting I became comfortable with in Bike Share and have also put into practice during the current Little Shop project. It's been helpful to utilize this git workflow to use our time more effectively when everyone is together
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
    During future projects I want to improve on our ability to utilize mentors as a group. Lee and I did this during Bike Share but we both thought that the time with my mentor could have been more effective. I would like to schedule time during each project to meet with each team members mentor{s} as a group. The learning that can take place in these settings seems to be some of the most valuable, and I hope to make the most of this time during future projects

  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

  I was effective as an approachable leader during our projects. I practiced active listening and allowed my teammates to be comfortable and express their ideas without holding back. This helped my teams thrive, because each member felt valued and empowered enough to speak freely and contribute. 

* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)
Date of feedback conversation: 
10/12/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? 
Lee and I decided we would meet after our evaluation on the same day. We had decided this during our gear-up and felt comfortable and confident speaking directly and openly

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

It went incredibly well. It was apparent to both of us that we enjoyed working together and had success as a pair. The conversation was easy because we had spent so much time together getting to know one another. We had become comfortable speaking freely because of mutual respect. It was a bit difficult finding coaching feedback, because I thought the pairing had been the best I had at Turing thus far


What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? 
We used mostly appreciation, but we also gave coaching. The coaching I received was helpful moving forward, and I hope Lee felt the same.

Any other comments: 
In-person should be required of each paired project. It certainly forces people to directly engage in a way that promotes growth

* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)

My story begins and ends with people. I've always been attracted to roles that allow me to engage with other humans in a meaningful way. I began my career in the service industry, which allowed me to become comfortable interacting with a variety of people from all walks of life. I learned how to be part of a team that relied on one another in order to be successful. I saw how a team worked well together, and I experienced the dynamics that led to failure. This helped me advocate for my own views, and become comfortable disagreeing in a respectful manner. I also understood that the service industry was a temporary place for me. 

As I became more confident dealing with others, I realized I had the ability to quickly gain trust and affection from strangers. This skill led me to sales. The energy required for sales positions is exhausting, but the rewards were quite lucrative. I learned that the ability to articulate your value is a skill that one should practice at all times regardless of industry. The need and desire to advocate for myself became much more attainable and apparent. I will own my own company in the near future, and the most important part of my role will be gaining the trust of others by convincing them to believe in me, my ability, and my goal. Learning the technical skills offered at Turing, as well as utilizing a few years as a developer for established companies will allow me to understand and implement the technical prowess necessary to run a successful business.

Why will you attend this particular event?
It's an industry I am currently involved in and want to always be learning about
Who do you hope to connect with at this event?
People smarter than me that are willing to offer guidance, information, and training within this field.
How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?
I will attend more events and schedule in-person meet ups with people that offer value with their time.
Warm Outreach: Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it! Describe:
I want to reach out to the head of image recognition at GoSpotCheck. His name is Sai.

Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about?
I want to connect with Sai because we met during Startup Week and he offered to help me in my software development journey. I hope to gain as much valuable information as possible about learning software in general.
When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet.

I will contact him via email and linkedin and I plan to meet him at a coffee shop downtown or their office as both are very clost to Turing.
What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them

My follow-up will consist of weekly emails that both offer some sort of information and opinions on a topic we have previously discussed as well as questions that I believe he will be able to answer and questions that will keep him interested and engaged with me as a mentee.
