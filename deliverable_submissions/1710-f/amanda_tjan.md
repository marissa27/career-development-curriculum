## Mod 2 Deliverables:


### Agile Work Flow:

* How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:

  * Without really realizing it, we have already been putting agile workflow into play at Turing. For the majority of our projects, we have been testing new features as we build them and even having 'users' test our products as we build them. For example with Game Time, we were getting feedback from people rather continuously over the course of the two weeks that we had to work on it. And once we started out building out more and more functionality, we had people test it to see if they could play the game. That way we were able to test bugs before we turned in the final project and because we were doing testing throughout the process we were able to adapt our process according to the feedback we were given. In future projects, I would like to build in more feedback from fellow classmates/people outside my group, to test what we are working on to see if it makes sense. 

* Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

  * My role as a teammate so far has sort of been the more abstract, problem solver. Because of my strengths and the way I work, it can sometimes be hard for me to stay on track because my mind runs at 100mph. But luckily, I have been paired with people that have been able to keep me on one path long enough for me to finish solving the problem. And in the end, based on the feedback that I have received, it seems like my broad sense of thinking has also helped them figure things out. 

### Feedback II reflection
* Date of feedback conversation: 
12/08/2017

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
To prepare for the conversation, I reflected on the overall success of the project. What I could have done better personally and how my partner helped (or didn't help) me do the best work possible. 

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
The conversation went very well because Ophus and I work very well together. We were both very honest about what worked for us the project and showed a lot of appreciation for the other person when things got difficult. There was a lot of acknowledgment for what went well during the project and what types of actions the other person did that were positive. With that being said, it was a good conversation for self-reflection. We both thought about times that we felt like we could've been better partners, used a different tone with the other person, etc. 

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? 
Appreciation 

* Any other comments: 
Partner: Ophus

### Professional Story (1-2 paragraphs)

Ever since I was little girl, I have been curious about everything there is to discover in the world. I've never been afraid to ask questions and jump into new projects. As I got older, this manifested itself in me moving from California to Boston for college, and then moving to Madrid, Spain once I finished my Bachelor degree. In Spain, I started off teaching English and was able to take advantage of my people skills and public speaking abilities in the classroom. After I started expanding my network in Spain, I eventually started to pursue a lifelong dream of mine to work in fashion. I had always loved the way that clothes could transform a person and become a way for them to express themselves. So when some friends that had stores offered to sell my creations, I started a jewelry collection. This seemed like the perfect combination of my strong business sense and strategic creativity and eventually led to me getting a Master in Accessories Design. Soon after finishing my degree, I moved to the north of Spain to work at Zara's headquarters as a stylist for their website. 

In theory, I had achieved all of my lifelong dreams I had of working in fashion, but I soon started to feel like something was missing at my job. What drives me is being able to make an impact in other people's lives, so even though I was part of a team that produced great content for Zara's e-commerce site, I wanted to be creative with a purpose. I also needed to incorporate my strategic way of thinking into whatever job I worked. This epiphany is what led me to look into writing code and becoming a front end developer. Being able to write code would still allow me to be creative, and I could creatively work on projects that made sense and weren't just trying to get people to buy things they didn't need. For the first time in years, I feel inspired and motivated again because I feel like I will be able to actually make an impact on the world with my new skill set. 

### Outreach & Networking

**Meetups/Networking Events:** Identify 1 meetup and/or other networking event that you'll attend between now and the end of Module 3. Answer these questions:

  * I plan to attend a Lady Killas event in January. Right now, my main goal as far as networking goes is to expand my network of strong boss women in Denver. This organization isn't necessarily tech focused, but it is focused on the growth of female leadership. My thoughts are that tech is everywhere and this could be a good opportunity to meet women that are working on different and interesting projects in Denver. I will follow up via LinkedIn or other social media platform. 

**Warm Outreach:** Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. *If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it!* Describe:

  * I have been doing warm outreach with various mentors, alums, and people in the community all Mod. At this point, I have 4 official mentors from the Turing community, so my goal is to find another mentor outside of the Turing community. Particularly, I want to start reaching out to developers in Madrid, since I am planning to go back there. I am still in the process of finding the right people to reach out too and waiting from responses from my friends at big companies that work with developers. Because of the distance, the plan would be to meet via Skype and then I'll follow-up via e-mail. I want to ask them about what the tech scene is like in Madrid since it is very distinct from the scene in the US.
