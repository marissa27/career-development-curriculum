## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:

  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions: What were you already doing? What did you put into place in Module Two? What was effective? What do you want to improve on in future projects?* 
  ** I have used the agile process many times here at Turing. In Mod 1, the instructors divided each project into phases, which was essentially defining the first MVP and building upon the MVP for each phase. In Mod 2, we were responsible for creating our own MVP for game time, so I got practice in defining what the minimum amount of functionality to work was. Once we had our MVP, we continued to work in the code and also let Turing students play the game. That way, as we built our code, we were able to incorporate user experiences into the creation of the next MVP. I found this strategy very effective in figuring out the bugs we had in our current MVP and what people wanted in the next update. I want to continue using this strategy and give access to our MVP to Turing students and also, people outside of Turing.
  
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
  ** I participated in two group projects this mod, one with Melena Suilteanu, the other with Valentino Valentine. Melena and I had a very similar level of code expertise. In our work, we agreed on several things: doing the javascript together and making sure we were spending an equal amount of time driving and navigating. We were successful in being both leaders and also supporting each other. We are both good communicators and were able to talk through challenges in code when stress was high. I also had a successful pairing with my last partner, Valentino Valentine. Valentino and I definitely had different strengths. I was technically more capable than him, so I wanted to make sure that he had the space to learn from this project. I ended up taking a lot more of the navigations. Since I am a very hands on person, I made sure to code everything again on my own time. Being a navigator was challenging for me. I am an introvert, so talking a lot and also leading tires me out quickly. However, I feel like the project helped me learn to lead and teach as a navigator.
  
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

  - Date of feedback conversation: 12/11/17
  
  - How did you prepare for the conversation?  
     I did a reflection of the two weeks we were working together on game time. I made a list of things that overall were very successful and created some examples of each. I made sure to think of her specific strengths in the project and how they 1) helped us create a better produce and 2) complimented my strengths and weaknesses as well. 

  - How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
     We had a really effective (and awesome) pairing and Melena and I are very similar in temperaments. Therefore, the conversation with her was easy and fun. We had just one morning where both of our stress levels were high and we had a few micro aggressions towards each other. When that happened, we took a little break, then apologized and talked about it, making sure to acknowledge our stress levels. In our reflection conversation, we talked about that morning and reviewed our strategy for dealing with stress. We talked about each other’s strengths and how we complimented each other really well, and gave some coaching feedback for each other. 
    
  - What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?  
    Appreciation and coaching. I gave her a list of her strengths and specific examples where they came into play. We also talked about how we paired together and came up with ideas about how we could have made our pair even better than it already was.
  
* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)
   - I am an avid nature enthusiast, a love that led me to pursue a career in ecology. I graduated from college with a major in biology, and took mostly ecology-related classes. Since graduation, I have worked in many biology related jobs - I have done botany, ornithology, and paleobiology research. I worked in education helping kids connect to nature through art and field experiences. I also worked as a horticulturalist both in greenhouse and landscaping settings. After three years, I realized the passion I had for learning ecology was not translating to passion in the workplace. This lack of interest is what led me to seek out a career change. 
  - I had always been interested in learning how to code and my chance came in the form of a free two day coding weekend geared towards minorities in the tech field. After the event, I starting learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on my own time. Eventually I decided to take the leap and invest in Turing School of Software & Design. I quickly grew to love software development and am thoroughly excited about my future. One thing Turing helped me realize, is that I am a learning-oriented person. The reason I did not find satisfaction in my previous career, is because every job I worked in required performing the same tasks, meticulously, over and over again. I am excited by a career in software development because I will always be challenging myself to expand my skills and learning new code. My goal is to combine my love for nature with my new knowledge and create technology that helps people connect to the world around them.
  
* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md)

 - The meetup plan: 
   - On Tuesday, January 16th I plan to attend the React w/ D3 and Drawing on a Map with deck.gl. I want to go to this event because I am interested in working in React after Turing. I hope to connect with people in the industry who are working in React and also learn companies in Denver that are using the React technology. I will follow-up via email or linkedIn - whatever they prefer.
  - The outreach plan:
    - I just emailed a woman named Lia James. She was a previous Turing instructor and I met her at a Tech Ladies Meet Up. I want to connect with her because she seems like she knows the tech industry well and might be able to point me to people and/or companies to connect to. I already contacted her and hopefully will meet with her in the near future! My follow-up will be an email thanking her for her time and updating on any advice she may have given me.
