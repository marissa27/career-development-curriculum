## Mod 2 Round Two Deliverables:

* How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
* What were you already doing?
I use waffle.io, Slack and it's screen share feature mostly for project management. Throughout the course of a group project 
I'll start with white boarding and wireframing. It helps conceptualize the project and break it down into managable components 
and helps divvy up the work.

* What did you put into place in Module Two?
In mod2 round 2 I made my need for more time known to my partner which helped with time management.

* What was effective?
I found getting to sleep at a reasonable time and then rising early more effective than trying to accomplish things whilst 
exhausted.

* What do you want to improve on in future projects?
Asking for help earlier on in a project and not struggling too long out of pride or embarssmenrt. 

* Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate?
How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
I tend to facilitate conversation, sharing helpful links or progress reports, trying to stimulate collaboration. I'm usually 
the one up late due to having a family and will pick up where others had made progress and expand on that.

* Feedback II reflection:
* Date of feedback conversation: 
12/6/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
Actively listening, self-reflection, reviewing github issues and slack conversations.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
It went well. My partner and I have a strong relationship and are supportive of each others' goals. Conversation flows easily
but sometime gets off track and constant attention is needed to stay on point. It's still difficult to give feedback about
areas needed for improvement.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
At the onset of the conversation we defined what were trying to accomplish and review. We each took turns actively listening 
for actionable ways we could improve and try to provide coachable techniques we found useful. We were careful to clearly convey
our feedback in a non-confrontationale manner.
