## Mod 2 Deliverables:

## Agile

* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:

    * What were you already doing?
    
Most of my projects already used a style similar to agile. We would take the project, look at what needed to get done, break it into it's smallest parts, and make a to-do list out of those tasks. Usually we use some kind of organization software like trello or waffle. Just like agile, we would take out a single piece of the to-do list, and make a commit. Every day we touch base with what we've done, what we're struggling with, and what we still have to do. In small projects like the ones we had in mod 1 it just seemed natural to divide the work that way and develop an agile work style.
    
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    
Module 2 was a lot of the same as mod 1, I find the easiest way to tackle a project, no matter the size, is to break it into it's smallest parts and chip away at it little by little. When I was working on Game Time, Kailin took on the biggest task of reorganizing our index.js and game.js file. We initially wrote it all on one page so fixing that was a huge task. To make sure our work didn't come to a standstill I checked in with her very often and kept pushing up the smaller projects that I worked on.    

    * What was effective?
    
Using waffle.io was the most effective thing we've done. It helps us keep track of all the small parts of our project so nothing gets lost. Humans have finite memories, that's why we rely on computers to keep track of our progress for us.   
   
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
    
In future projects I want to get better with my refactoring. I need to work on finding ways to clean up my code. Right now I am at a point where I don't have a full grasp of all of the tools in my belt in terms of making code as clean as possible, but as I work, and as I learn more, refactoring will become easier. And, ideally, my code will be cleaner the first time.
    
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
  
My role as a teammate in my projects was just that, a teammate. I make sure, that as a team member I take care of all of the tasks assigned to me, whether I choose them myself or someone gives them to me. I think it is vital to have my work taken care of that way I can lend support to the rest of my team. I found that my teammates know that I'm someone they can turn to when they have questions. I want them to feel that way because I like to help them and solve problems. I also know that if I'm ever stuck they'll be happy to return the favor.

## Feedback II

* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

  * Date of feedback conversation: 
12/08/2017

  * How did you prepare for the conversation? 

During the project, usually after long sessions of work or at the end of the day we would discuss how the day went and how we were both feeling about the project and each other. So I took into account all of those conversations along with reflecting on how I thought the project went in the end.

  * How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

I thought the conversation went very well. Our whole project went smoothly. Our conversation about the project went just as smoothly, we both feel we worked hard and made amazing progress. Discussing all the things that went well in the project were easy to talk about because we were reveling in our victories. The most difficult thing to talk about was the coaching. We acknowledged that we both have more to learn, but we understand that as students, that's exactly why we're here.

  * What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? 

We used positive feedback, acknowledgement of our successes, and coaching.

## Professional Story

* Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)

  I have always been passionate about personal growth, self improvement, and making people happy. I was a film major in college because I love movies and I love creating things. The film industry was not what I expected it to be. I ended up doing coffee runs and trips to staples more often than being able to do any meaningful work or expressing creativity. On top of that, most jobs that I found were unpaid. Working for free prevented my personal growth because it meant I couldn't afford to move out of my parents' house. I got my bartending license and started making money working for restaurants. A director at of my production jobs told me I would "follow the money". And while he was right about that, I also gained experiences from bartending that the film industry didn't offer to me. I was also able to be creative behind the bar. I made drinks and I created new drinks and was "the host of the party" every night. I was able to grow because this job gave me income, and I would make people happy by giving them what they wanted. Service with a smile.
  
  While bartending was an excellent job I still needed to grow more. I was only making enough to get by, and still living at my parents house. I've always enjoyed technology, and with my other strengths I found myself well suited in a sales position working for Verizon Wireless. This job achieved many goals for me. I was able to make people happpy by fixing their phones, which I loved doing because each one was a new puzzle to solve, and setting them up with technology to make their lives easier. I was also able to work my way up to a full time position and eventually move out of my parents' house.
  
  I left Verizon because their motivations started to shift. The job became less about helping people and more about making the sale regardless of what the customer actually wants. Time spent ensuring a customer had a great experience was frowned upon if it didn't result in them opening up their wallets. I took to code because of my love for solving problems. I have learned that in a coding position I'll be able to be creative, solve problems, and create websites and programs that people want or need to use. During my time at Turing I focused on growth outside of my career as well. I picked up and moved to Denver, CO. I spent every day improving my coding skills. Any time not spent coding was spent training for a half marathon and preparing my meals for the week. Code school was the catalyst for the majority of my self improvement and I'm looking forward to the next step where I can take everything I've learned and apply it to my next career.

# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?
 
As a pair programmer I am showing people that I have a lot to offer as far as getting the job done. My partners and I selected motivating, driven, positive, and knowledgeable. I think these skills describe a strong work ethic and describe me as a powerful part of the pair. I think I'm showing people that I'm a very useful parter in a pairing situation.

* How do you use your strengths as a team member?

I try to stay focused and positive when facing challenges. I think a lot of what people said about me in my blind spot, I do see about myself, but with only 15 words to select I had to eliminate a lot of the choices.

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?

I like the majority of words that came up in my blind spot, I think they're true to who I am and who I want to be. Some of the words that were selected for me I would like to focus more on to make a change. Needy is one of the words chosen for me, which I think links to my selection of self-consious in the Facade block. I think if I work on my confidence in times of discomfort, both of those words would fall into the unknown.

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate?

The "uncompromising" trait. I think it can be a good thing, as in someone who stands strong in their values. I can also see how it's a negative thing, as in one who does not compromise. I want to make sure I stay on the positive side of that trait.

* How would you like your teammates to see you?

Friendly, Kind, clever, caring, logical, driven, knowledgable, motivating, positive.

* Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md)

# Outreach & Networking Plan for Module 3
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try in Module 3. 

**Meetups/Networking Events:** Identify 1 meetup and/or other networking event that you'll attend between now and the end of Module 3. Answer these questions:

* Why will you attend this particular event?

  I have already attended a Denver Devs meetup. It was a happy hour event. I chose it because it seemed like a very laid back event where I could just go and introduce myself to the people there without discussing code and jobs too heavily. It was a nice way to get introduced to the people who attend the event.
  
* Who do you hope to connect with at this event?

  I was just looking forward to meeting whoever would be willing to talk to me. Which, as it turned out, was basically everyone. Networking there was very casual and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. It was not as intimidating as I thought it would be.

* How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?

  At the first event I didn't really manage to follow up with anyone but I am paying attention to the Denver Devs slack channel and keeping an eye out for more meetups to go to. I figure once I start attending enough that people start to recognize me, I'll move on to the next phase and start contacting those people directly and eventually meet up with them outside of Denver Devs meetups.

**Warm Outreach:** Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. *If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it!* Describe:

* Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about

  I have already found a mentor from the Mentor list. I wanted to contact her because her description on the list included a lot of my hobbies outside of coding. She is also local to denver which means we'd be able to meet at turing if we wanted to pair in person.

* When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet

  So far our communication has been mostly through slack. I set up a video chat for the first time we met but since then it has been mostly DMing through slack. It seems to work best for both of us. 

* What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them

  Our plan is to keep in touch and I'll reach out whenever I have questions. I have also made a point to reach out occasionally just to see how things are going in the attempt to make a more casual conversation. Also I don't want to get in the pattern of only reaching out when I have a question about code.
