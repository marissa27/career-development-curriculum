Project: Night Writer

Group Member Names: Ellen Cornelius and Matt Milton

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Matt hopes to get a valid understanding of string manipulation with weird characters.
Ellen hopes to get a solid understanding of files stuff, including input/output, pairing methods.


Goals and expectations:
 Wednesday morning prototype of Night Writer operates and then from there, we can work on extensions.
 Defining prototype working:
    -all evaluation expectations are met
    -all tests are done and working
    -refractor so that each method is less than 8 lines

Team strengths: Matt is honest, direct, and patient. Ellen is flexible, good at checking in, can always see the forest from the trees. We seem to be good at communicating and respecting each other.

How to overcome obstacles: Keep our spirits up and maintain as positive an attitude as possible. Bring each other up and limit self-denigration. Ask for help when head has been banging up against the wall for longer than 1 hour. When needing help, make sure we have clear concise questions about what we are struggling on.  

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
  Friday December 8th - Ellen meets mentor at 5pm today.
  Saturday December 9th - Matt has to cut down Xmas tree so cannot get to Turing before 11am
  Sunday December 10th - Matt has an obligation from 2:30 - 6pm.
  Monday December 11th - Aim for getting to Turing by 7:30-7:45am and try to stay until 7pm
  Tuesday December 12th - Aim for getting to Turing by 7:30-7:45am and try to stay until 7pm
  Wednesday December 13th - Prototype done before class.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
Do retro's in the morning and end of each work session. As for communication means, slack, text message, and email. In the case of canceling or emergency, a phone call is preferred.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Ellen
Technical strengths - good at understanding complex ideas after exposition or reading, great at visualizing problems, and solid understanding of using the pry environment.

Desired improvement - improve listening skills (auditory learning) for technical concepts

Matt
Technical strengths - Kinesthetic learning, pretty good at math, take good notes, and solid ability to be a librarian when i don't know what to do.

Desired improvement - spell better, string special character manipulation, testing edge cases, and github.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
One repo on Ellen's github. Both must review code before pushing or updating main repo. Try to review code and explain to partner every day during retro.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Honest and effective communication when there is a way of improving a method. Defend your method when other individual thinks there exists a better method. In said case, better methoder must be receptive to other method.

Agenda to discuss project launch:
 Serious breakdown and delegating of tasks Saturday morning (include scheduling of each expectation, writing specs, psuedocoding). Writing code must start early Saturday.
