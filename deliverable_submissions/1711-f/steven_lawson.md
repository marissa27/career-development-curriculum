Strengths and Storytelling

# Steven Strengths:
## Connectedness
## Empathy
## Context
## Intellection
## Learner

My strengths have been evident since I began Turing, though I don't always see them manifest as strengths, necessarily. In Turing life, the most applicable are Context, Intellection, and Learner. Context as in I need to see everything contextually to understand it (big picture), Learner because I do enjoy learning, and Intellection, where my mind is constantly humming, but not always in a productive manner.

At Turing, I have struggled with not being able to see the full picture at a given moment. I have dealt with this struggle by trying to break a very big-picture-problem into very small parts; something that doesn't come natural to me but I am getting better at. I have succeeded in becoming proficient in CSS and JavaScript in a mere 4 weeks, which was hard to imagine that could happen in such a short time, but I am getting there, somehow.

I've accomplished these successes by really putting in time with coding: Almost everyday has been between 10-13 hours, and just practice "cutting vegetables" over and over and over again.

# Future Vision

I will become an integral part of an exciting team of developers for a forward-thinking company whose mission statement and philosophy includes a pro-active view of improving American society with social justice and environmentally sustainable priciples, where I am valued for my creative problem solving and leadership abilities.
