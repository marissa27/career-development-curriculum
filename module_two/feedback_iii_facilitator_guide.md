# Feedback III (Module Two, Week Four)

## Facilitator Guide

### Prep
Prior to the session, send out a Slack message to the cohorts to have them log into the Johari Window app using this link: https://johariwindow.herokuapp.com/
* Notes: the link needs to include “https://” and students must log in with GitHub
* Depending on how much time you’ll need to create the partner groups for the session, you may want to send that message out sooner

You’ll need to create groups for each student on the app with the people they’ve worked in projects with, both in M1 and M2. You’ll probably want to track this on a spreadsheet first and then create the groups in the app. For your reference, here are the paired or group projects that you’ll need to include:
 * B1: 
   * M1 paired project #1 (varies)
   * Black Thursday
   * Bike Share
 * F1:
   * Linked List
   * IdeaBox
   * 2DoBox
   * Game Time

You can find the partners from these projects in this [repo](https://github.com/turingschool/roster/tree/master/data); however, instructors do not always update this, so you may have to do some investigating, using both the M1 feedback sheets and anything posted in the instructor and/or cohort channels to let you know who’s paired with whom. *For any students who have paired with students who are repeating a previous module or have withdrawn from the program, don’t worry about including them in the groups*

### Session Outcomes

* Students are able to analyze their reactions and feelings about feedback
* Students are able to discuss and apply the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to feedback reflections
* Students are able to use the Johari Window technique to recognize their own blind spots
* Students are able to create goals for how to improve their collaboration practices

### Logistics

| Set Up | Materials Needed | PPT Link (if PPT)|
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| How should the room be set up? What AV is needed? | Students should have journals, something to write with, and their laptops. You need your laptop to present slides. | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lH5XdpZSGBr6vgFU2yDESI1VnsJ-7Pbihh4joe3pUBI/edit?usp=sharing) |

| Opening (5 mins)                            | Using slide 3, read through the objectives for the session, and then flip to slide 4 to discuss the deliverable. Say: **"In our third and final feedback session, we'll spend time reflecting on how we can find meaning in the feedback we receive and make concrete action plans for how to improve our practices and behaviors."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Students listen, take notes                                    |
| Feedback Pulse Check (5 mins)               | Using slide 6, say: **"Take a pulse check by assessing yourself on how you feel about each statement on feedback."** Give students 5 minutes for them to fill out their self-ratings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Students rate themselves in their journals or on laptops       |
| Turn & Talk; Debrief (6 mins)               | Instruct students to turn to the person next to them to share their ratings. After 5 mins, ask some groups to share out what they had in common and what parts of feedback test their growth mindsets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students share their ratings with each other                   |

That's a valid feeling resulting from a trigger and the impact that the feedback has on you -- go with it. Pay attention to why you're having this impact."** Move to slide 8 and walk through the chart, stressing how important it is to pay attention to the inner voice (the first column), then listen for additional information (second column), and ask clarifying questions (the third column) in order to move through feedback triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Students listen, take notes                                    |
| Demonstrate Right & Wrong Spotting (5 mins) | Move to slide 9 and say: **"Now to turn the feedback into something useful, you'll want to separate what's triggering you or what's wrong with the feedback from what's helpful or what's right with the feedback by creating a t-chart like this."** Draw the t-chart on the board and demonstrate using feedback from feedback that you recently received; this feedback could come from a student survey or SAB or anything useful for this demonstration.

| Right & Wrong Spotting: Activity (5 mins)   | Using slide 10, instruct students to create a right and wrong spotting table either in their journals or in a document for themselves and reflect on feedback they've received recently to first acknowledge the parts that trigger them and then decide what could be right and helpful about the feedback. Circulate the room to answer questions as needed and ensure everyone is on task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Students work on right/wrong spotting charts independently.    |
| Intro to Johari Window (5 mins)             | Using slide 11, explain what a Johari Window is by saying: **"The Johari Window is a technique used to help people better understand their relationship both with themselves and others. You'll pick out words that describe you and your previous project partners will do the same in regards to how you've worked together. Those words will end up in these 4 quadrants."** Point to each quadrant as you discuss it: **"The top left quadrant represents words that you and your partners picked to describe you, so these are things that you both see you doing. The top right quadrant represents blind spots, showing words that your partners picked for you but that you did not pick for yourself. This will help you think about what others see from you that you aren't aware of. In the bottom left quadrant are words that you picked about yourself that others did not. These may be things that you are not yet expressing although you would like to. Finally, the bottom right quadrant represents words that neither you nor your partners picked for you -- in the app, this will be the longest list as it will show all the words not picked. But this can help you consider if you'd like to be expressing these words in the future."** Then switch to slide 12, which has Allison's example on it. You should customize this slide if you have a Johari Window to show or you can talk about Allison's blind spots. She circled 5 words that were hard feedback for her; she reflected on specific ways she may have been acting in that capacity in order to decide how to change her behavior. For example, she reflected that she can sometimes not appear flexible when she has her heart set on doing something a certain way, and she recognized that could be why she was characterized as "rigid" or "withholding." The point of this slide is to help students see the value in considering others' perspectives in their feedback.  | Students listen, take notes                                    |
| Johari Window Activity (20 mins)            | Instruct students to log into the Johari Window app. Repost the link:[https://johariwindow.herokuapp.com/](https://johariwindow.herokuapp.com/) in their Slack channels. Say: **"When you log in, go to assignments to see the surveys you should fill out. Due to a glitch in the app, you'll see some names of people you haven't worked with. Don't worry about filling out surveys for them. Just fill out surveys for yourself and partners you've worked with. After you've filled out their surveys, their names will appear greyed out on the assignments page. You'll need to select 15 adjectives for each person. If the counter does not count correctly, refresh the page. Once you're finished, look at your window and begin to reflect on the different outcomes, especially the Blind Spots quadrants."** Ensure all students have been able to log in and get started. Troubleshoot as needed, but the app has some bugs. Let the students know that they should refresh often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students fill out Johari Window surveys and reflect on results |
