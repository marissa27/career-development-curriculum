| Opening (5 mins)             | Using Slide 3, say: **"In the technology industry, even more so than in other industries, getting ahead in your career comes down to who you know. Establishing strong connections with others in the technology community starts while you're at Turing and will be a focal point of your job search. In this session, we'll focus on how you can start building those relationships through utilizing the practices of outreach and networking. Building relationships with developers and others in the tech community might feel daunting, so start with smaller steps, such as the Turing network (mentors, posses, alumni, student groups, guest speakers) and meetups and events that happen at Turing or are Turing-affiliated. Then, move onto bigger steps -- cold outreach, which is reaching out to contacts at companies you don't already have a connection with; attending meetups, conferences, and participating in hackathons that aren't connected to Turing; and don't forget about contributing to open source projects not affiliated with Turing. Embracing outreach and networking will help you both in your initial job search after Turing and in your overall career"** Switch to Slide 4 and read through the objectives and the deliverable that students are expected to complete. Post the link to the outreach/networking guidelines in the cohorts' channels and provide a minute for questions about the deliverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Students follow along, take notes, ask questions as needed       |
| Intro to Outreach (10 mins)  | Using Slide 6, say: **"Let's start with Warm Outreach and think specifically about mentors. Turing mentors have signed up to be part of the community because they want to connect with you and help you with your learning and your careers."** Switch to Slide 7, and say: **"You can create a relationship with a mentor (or more than one) for many reasons. Before you reach out to just anyone, decide what your purpose is and do some research using the spreadsheet as a jumping off point. You can talk to mentors about anything from project help to career advice. If you're interested in a particular location, see which mentors live there and can give you some advice on the networks in that area. Interested in a particular technology? Which mentors are using it already?"** Using Slide 8, repost the mentor spreadsheet in the cohorts' channels and provide students with 2 minutes to start looking through the spreadsheet. Mention that they can make a copy of the spreadsheet to make their own notes if they'd like. Using Slide 9, show students where they can find the list of their mentors in a posse channel and say: **"If you reach out to your posse mentors, you'll still want to do some research on them -- especially if you're trying to set up a meeting with them as many of them aren't in Denver."** Using Slide 10, say: **"Beyond mentors, think of the people who are already in your network that you can connect with. How can you start building stronger relationships with people already within your reach?"** Using Slide 11, say: **"If you want to challenge yourself, start utilizing cold outreach by reaching out to people who work at companies you're interested in but you don't currently have a network with. This is extremely useful both for practice and to build new relationships. Now is a great time to start, but you'll definitely want to make cold outreach a habit in Modules 3 and 4."** Using Slide 12, say: **"Any time you're reaching out to someone new, you'll want to do some research first. Here are some suggestions of how you can research different contacts."** Using Slide 13, say: **"There are also lots of tools to help you find someone's contact information. There are many sites that will help you find emails, but be sure to check their GitHub profile or personal site as they may have it listed there already. LinkedIn inmail is usually not as effective because it's not intuitive -- many people miss those messages. Stick to finding an email address whenever possible."** Switch to Slide 14 and ask students: **"Why would you reach out to a cold contact?"** Solicit a few responses, but the response you do NOT want to hear is "To get a job/ask about a job opening." Tell students: **"You are trying to build a relationship, and you can't jump into a conversation immediately asking for something. Networking is often compared to dating -- you wouldn't sit down on a first date and say 'I'm looking for a longterm relationship, are you the person for me?' That's implied; that's why you're on the date. But stating it is off-putting. Same with networking. They know that you're looking for a job, and they want to help you through the advice and network they can offer. But they can't give you a job. Instead, your purpose is around *gathering information.* I often refer to these as Research Conversations; you may have heard of 'informational interviews,' but I prefer research conversation because it takes the word 'interview' out of it to make sure there's no confusion about what this conversation is about. There are some helpful questions to get you started listed in the link on the slide, but whether with warm or cold contacts, you want to set expectations for the conversation and go from there."**  | Students take notes, participate in discussion when called on    |
| Crafting the Email (5 mins)  | Using Slides 15 - 21, walk through the stage of crafting an outreach message. Say: **"Create a template that will help you stay on message, but remember to customize it for anyone that you send it to. Use the subject line and a simple greeting. Make sure to spell the person's name right -- you laugh, but we've gotten feedback from mentors that sometimes students have misspelled their name. Make sure to proofread! In the body of the email, discuss who you are and what you'd like to talk about. Mention anything that you have in common. Include a call to action -- what do you want the contact to do after reading this message? Suggest a meeting time that will make it easy for the person to respond quickly with either 'yes' or 'no.' When closing out the message, again, make it easy for the person to find out more information about you with any pertinent links."** Read through the additional things for students to consider on slides 20 and 21.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students follow along and ask questions as needed                |
| Outreach Examples (5 mins)   | Using Slide 23, read the example of warm outreach on the slide and ask students for their takeaways. Solicit answers from the class or cold call, starting with **"what is working in this example?"** Possible answers: *Gaby includes specifics of what she wants to talk about,* *she includes a call to action that would make it easy for Jose to respond to,* etc. Then, move to **"what would you do differently in this example?"** Possible answers: *Gaby uses the phrase 'figured it's about time to find a mentor,' which might make the mentor feel like she feels obligated to talk to him.*  Say: **"Correct, this example is used because a student actually wrote this in an email to a mentor before -- and mentors tell us when things like this happen. You definitely wouldn't want the mentor to feel like you're only contacting them out of obligation. Find a mentor you want to connect with, and this won't be an issue."** You might also receive an answer about how the call to action might be too direct; your response can be something along the lines of **"sometimes we hear from mentors that students reach out to them without a lot of direction, and they'll go back and forth for a week or two without actually finding a time to meet. So being direct can very helpful to get the ball rolling."** Switch to Slide 24, read the example of cold outreach from the slide and ask students for their takeaways again, starting with **"what is working in this example?"** Possible answers: *Katrina mentioned their mutual contact,* *she included her contact information at the end of the message,* etc. Then, move to **"what would you do differently in this example?"** Possible answers: *Katrina asked about a job, which seems to negate everything she said previously.* Say: **"Correct, again, you don't want to ask for a job, especially when they haven't offered any information on a position. Use this opportunity to get to know the other person."** You might also receive an answer about how the call to action is a little informal with the phrase 'hop on a call'; your response can be something along the lines of **"That's a good point because if you're Katrina, you don't actually know Mark and you might want to keep your communication a little more direct until you know each other better."** Answer any other questions the students might have about the examples before moving on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Students participate in discussion about examples                |
| Outreach Practice (20 mins)  | Using Slide 26, instruct students to spend 10 minutes crafting an email to a contact they want to reach out to, whether it's a mentor or someone else. Mention that if they're reaching out to a mentor who has only listed Slack on the spreadsheet, they don't need to worry about a subject line (because you will get a question about that). After 10 minutes, switch to Slide 27 and instruct students to get into groups of 3-4 people to share their drafts and provide feedback to each other. Remind students that feedback should be *specific, actionable,* and *kind.* Provide the students with 8 minutes for their group discussion.
