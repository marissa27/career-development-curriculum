| Waterfall vs. Agile (25 mins)                        | Jeff will lead the lecture and discussion for Slides 7-14 (Ellen Mary should change slides). Ensure there is time for a Turn & Talk (slide 15) and then cold call on 2 groups or so to share out their takeaways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Students take notes; participate in Turn & Talk                  |

| Tuckman's Group Life Cycle (6 mins)                  | Using Slide 23, introduce the concept of Tuckman's Group Life Cycle. Queue up this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhSI6oBQmQA&list=PLbu6naAjG_K93h0wjyn1b1EHQl1Q2pH_y) to show to the whole group; pause it during the Forming discussion to remind students that we call this part the DTR. Pause it at other parts of the video to ask questions of the group. Then ask the whole group what these stages look like in practice.                                                                                  | Students watch video                                             |
| Intro to StrengthsFinder Leadership Domains (5 mins) | Using Slides 24 and 25, introduce the 4 kinds of leadership domains that correspond with StrengthsFinder strengths. Describe an example; Jeff is a good example since students have just learned from him. You can say something like, **"what is Jeff's leading domain?"** Students will most likely answer "influencing" because of his ability to tell stories. Tell students to reflect for a few minutes using Slide 25 to figure out which domains they fall into and be prepared to share with their project groups.  | Students follow along and participate when necessary             |
| Project Group Discussion (15 mins)                   | Switch to Slide 26 and instruct BE students to get into their Bike Share groups and FE students to get with their Game Time partners to have discussions about their strengths leadership domains and the questions listed on the slide. Circulate the room to ensure groups are on task and to listen to their responses. After 10 minutes, bring the groups back together to ask for 2-3 groups to share out their takeaways from their discussions.                                                                       | Students participate in discussions with their partners          |
| Closing (1 min)                                      | Close the session with Slide 27 by asking for group takeaways with this question: **"How will you continue to apply these principles during the rest of your time at Turing?"**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Students participate in discussion                               |
