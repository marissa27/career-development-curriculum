* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
<br>I had a great group to work with on this project.
<br>Working in a larger group, communication is always a concern; however, we communicated really well.
<br>Giving feedback was easy because after working together and communicating through our project we were able to communicate our feedback as well.
<br>We each talked about what went well, why it was successful, and the parts we agreed we could imrpove on.
<br>It was a good retro because we were able to acknowledge the good as well as the bad.
