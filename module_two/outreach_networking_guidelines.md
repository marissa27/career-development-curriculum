# Outreach & Networking Plan for Module 3
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try in Module 3. 

**Meetups/Networking Events:** Identify 1 meetup and/or other networking event that you'll attend between now and the end of Module 3. Answer these questions:

* Why will you attend this particular event?
* Who do you hope to connect with at this event?
* How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?

**Warm Outreach:** Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module 3. *If you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it!* Describe:

* Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about
* When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet
* What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them
