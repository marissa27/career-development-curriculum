### Objectives (Jeff & Allison)
* Describe the general concept of the "waterfall" model
* Explain how "agile" differs from waterfall
* Explain the idea of a sprint
* Write a story following a template
* Describe how you use your strengths and leadership skills in teams
* Describe how you might adapt your strengths according to team dynamics
* Discuss how to leverage each others' strengths to work even more effectively in your project

### Deliverable (Allison)
By Monday of Week 6, submit a written reflection on:
* How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:
   * What were you already doing? 
   * What did you put into place in Module Two?
   * What was effective?
   * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
* Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

### Connections: The Why (Jeff & Allison)
To build great software we need to be intentional about the **process**. Whether working solo or in groups, your process is a more significant determiner of your project's success than your technical skill. And refining your process helps you establish your place in the industry as an emerging developer. 

In this session we'll take a quick overview of "Waterfall," "Agile," how to begin better managing your projects at Turing, and how to build even better teams. 

### Waterfall vs. Agile (Jeff)

![Agile vs. Waterfall](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Agile%20vs.%20Waterfall.png)

#### Waterfall
1. Requirements - the big book of features
2. Technical Design - "architects"
3. Implementation - "code monkeys"
4. Verification - handoff to Q/A
5. Maintenance - let interns fix the bugs
 
#### Strengths of Waterfall

* Once requirements are set, you can estimate how long it'll take to build. But...you're wrong.
* Easy to stagger teams, have one hand off to the next each phase
* Spend a long time in 1 & 2 billing clients and you don't have to build anything
* When the project fails you blame the requirements and those people are long gone

#### Problems of Waterfall

* Writing requirements is impossible
* Each phase takes months/years -- quickly outdated
* No chance to "listen to the code"
* No user feedback until complete
* No potential for revenue until complete
* It just doesn't work

#### Agile

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Verification
5. Feedback & Approval
6. Go to 1

#### Problems with Agile

* No real estimate of the total cost
* People won't shut up about it
* Need to have cross-functional teams
* A whole lot of conversation ("I've never seen a project fail...")

#### Strengths of Agile

* Responsive to the user / product owner
* "Discover" the better solutions along the way
* Can grow organically
* Easier to stop early
* Possible to generate revenue along the way

#### Agile in the Real World

* GitHub's story
* Eric Ries' "The Lean Startup"
* [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), written in 2001 and has its merits and its flaws
 
#### Turn & Talk:
* When does it make sense to use the Waterfall method? When does it make sense to use Agile?
* How do you see Agile already being used in your processes at Turing?
* How does Agile describe teamwork to you?

1-3 groups share out takeaways to the whole group. 

### Agile in Practice (Jeff)
There are all kinds of strategies, frameworks, and buzzwords around agile development. But everything revolves around *stories* and *sprints*.

#### The Sprint

A sprint is the time box that our work fits into.

* Typical sprint is 2 weeks
* Starts with planning (aka requirements)
* It always takes longer than planned
* Cut scope or extend time?
* Always cut scope (half, not half-assed)
* Features are delivered in production
* Solicit user feedback
* Ends with review/retrospective

Ways to structure a sprint:
* Scrum:

#### A Story

"How to Write (Good) Stories" is a 90-minute lesson unto itself. But let's do the express version. A good story:

* Exhibits a tiny chunk of business value
* Is written in a common format
* Can be clearly demonstrated/verified
* Represents half a work day of labor, or less!

#### A Template for Stories

```plain
As a(n) [user type]
In order to [extract business value]
When I [take some action]
  (and [take some other action])
Then I [observe an outcome]
  (and I [observe another outcome])
```

#### Quick Story Writing Practice

Let's start with some ideas that translate well to single stories.

*Imagine* we've prototyped a small to-do list app. It just allows the user to create to-dos. And it only supports a single user.

**You Do:**
Start on your own and draft one story for *each* of the following:

*   Checking the box for a to-do moves it to the completed list
*   The top of the todo list has a count of the number to todos which updates when I add a new one
*   Clicking trash on a to-do pops up a confirm/cancel dialog

Then, **Turn & Talk** to share your results.

### Where to Go From Here: Project Management Tools (Jeff)
* Start using a project management tool, like Waffle
* Turn your requirements into stories following the above template
* Prioritize stories and schedule sprints (even just 2-3 days)
* Deploy to production, maybe solicit feedback from "users"
* Cutting scope is ok, cutting quality isn't

### How Teams Work Together (Allison)
Now let's talk now about how teams work together.

#### Whole Group Introduction
* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
* When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?

#### Tuckman's Group Life Cycle
* Forming
* Storming
* Norming
* Performing
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhSI6oBQmQA&list=PLbu6naAjG_K93h0wjyn1b1EHQl1Q2pH_y)
   * We'll pause to discuss at different parts of the stage

#### StrengthsFinder: Leadership Domains
Let's consider how our strengths play a part in the types of roles we take on in our project groups. 

Four Domains of Leadership in Strengths:
  * **Executing:** Team members who have a dominant strength in Executing are those you turn to time and again to implement a solution. These people work tirelessly to get something done. People who are strong in the Executing domain have an ability to take an idea and transform it into a reality within the organization they lead
  * **Influencing:** People who are innately good at influencing are always selling the team’s ideas inside and outside the organization. When you need someone to take charge, speak up, and make sure your group is heard, look to someone with Influence.
  * **Relationship Building:** Relationship Builders are the glue that holds a team together. Strengths associated with bringing people together -- whether it is by keeping distractions at bay or keeping the collective energy high -- transform a group of individuals into a team capable of carrying out complex projects and goals.
  * **Strategic Thinking:** Those who are able to keep people focused on “what they could” be are constantly pulling a team and its members into the future. They continually absorb and analyze information and help the team make better decisions. 

![SF Leadership Domains](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/SF%20Leadership%20Domains.png)

What does this tell you about your own leadership style?

#### Project Team Discussion

* Share your strengths with each other -- what do they mean? How do you interpret these strengths in your day-to-day work? 
* Describe a “high point” moment as a team so far -- when has your team worked at its absolute best? How have you moved through Tuckman's stages?
* What are your domains of strengths? How have you seen these in action working together so far? What are the impacts of these domains on the team? 
* What domains are not covered as much in your current team? How does that affect your team’s performance? 

### Closing
How will you continue to apply these principles during the rest of your time at Turing?
