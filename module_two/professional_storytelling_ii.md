Length: 60 mins

* Opening/Hook: 5 mins
* Discuss storytelling: 20 mins
* Individual Practice: 10-15 mins
* Feedback Groups: 15-20 mins
* Closing: 5 mins

### Objectives
* Understand the purpose of a professional story -- *and what it shouldn't include*
* Explore examples of effective professional stories
* Revise and refine your professional story and how you tell it 
* Provide feedback on your classmates' stories and incorporate their feedback into improving your own

### Deliverable
* Include a working draft of your professional story (1-2 paragraphs) as a gist in your PD deliverables due Monday of Week 6

### The Why/Hook
In Module One, we dove into exploring who we are through discussions of:
* Our working styles -- where we fall on the introversion/extroversion spectrum
* Our strengths
* The lenses and identities through which we see the world

In this session, we'll continue to build on this self-awareness to lend to our professional stories. From your professional story, we'll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.   

We are all inherent storytellers, and the aim of today's session is to expand on your professional story and turn it into a compelling narrative. 

### Telling Your Story
Our lives are made up of stories -- they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

**Disclaimer:** When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring. 

These three questions are the basis of telling your story:  

* **Who are you?** *(as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)*
* **Why are you here?** *(Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)*
* **What's next?** *(Where do you see yourself going in this career?)* 


**Review as whole group:** What elements make a compelling story?

Examples: something's at stake, relatable protagonist, overcoming obstacles, turning points, a satisfying ending.

Your story is one of **transition.** These stories are inherently interesting as they have all the elements of a classic story, and most importantly, they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition. Where are you going? What will happen next? It's so exciting for the listener! But it also depends on how you tell that story. Let's look at some examples... 

#### Story Examples: Which story is more compelling? 
During a networking event explored in this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story), senior managers who'd been downsized took turns telling what they had done before and what they were looking for next. Which of these stories is more interesting for you as a listener?

Story #1: "I started my career as a teacher, and after that, I went to grad school to get my MFA in creative writing. I did some work in publishing during grad school and also worked for an education nonprofit. After that, I moved to Denver and started working at an elementary school as the Director of School Operations. After I left the school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do next, but I received an email from Joanne at Turing about a new position. I thought it sounded like a great opportunity, so I interviewed and then started working at Turing. After this job, I think I'll look for something that combines education and coaching since that's what my job entails now."

Story #2: "I wasn't always sure what I wanted to do for a living, but one thing I do know is that I love to help people. This was the driving force behind my decision to join Teach for America after college. I enjoyed teaching because it allowed me to help my students and connect with them on a personal level, but I didn't enjoy the bureaucracy of working in K-12 education. This became really clear for me when I took a job as an administrator at an elementary school when I first moved to Denver. I had thought that because education had made up the bulk of my career, that this was the logical next step. But I wasn't happy, and it was clear that I needed a change. I wasn't sure what that change could be, but I decided to leave my job and take time to figure it out. During this time of self-discovery, I heard about Turing and realized that this could be an opportunity to combine my love for helping others and grow in my own understanding of what that meant. This opened me up to discovering professional coaching and apply that to assisting my students as they transition careers. I feel like I have a much more clear path now that also makes me happy and able to do what I love every day. I want to continue to impact the tech industry in a positive way by helping people from all walks of life utilize their potential and transition to this industry successfully." 

**Discuss:**

* What is the difference between these two stories? What elements do you see in each story?
* Which character did you care about more? Why?
* Based on these examples, what should your story *not* be?

The second story focuses more on the turning points -- the moments that cause your listener to ask, *"What happened next?"*

Now, let's apply these ideas to your own story and practice telling it. 

### You Do: Individual Story-writing

**Write:** Reflect on your experience entering your new career in the software industry and write a draft of your story, answering the questions **who are you, why are you here, what's next?** Think about how others might root for you as a character and what's at stake for you in your career transition. Consider:

* Your Strengths: what makes you the "hero" of this story?
	* From StrengthsFinder, reflect on how developing your strengths at Turing has influenced your story
* How have you grown at Turing? What obstacles have you overcome? 
* What turning points led you to make this career change?
* What does your third act look like? How does transitioning to this career bring some closure to this narrative arc?
* Describe causality -- what made you want to make this career change? How is it grounded in your character?
* How you can create trust with the listener
* Creating coherence in your story
* Utilize a story form
* Tell multiple stories -- how can you adapt your story to different situations?

### Feedback Groups
Form groups of 3-4 people who you will share your story with. Each person will have approximately 2 minutes to share their story, and then your groupmates will provide you with 3 minutes of feedback. 

Feedback should include:
* **Appreciation** on what is compelling about the story
* **Coaching** on anything that isn't clear or about the partner's storytelling skills can be improved. 
* Principles of being specific, actionable, and kind 

### Closing
**Whole Group Debrief:** What takeaways do you have about what makes an effective professional story?

**Next Steps:**
Looking ahead at Module 3:
* Drafting your resume
* Creating your [Turing portfolio](turing.io/alumni)
* Consider how you can talk about yourself in networking settings, such as meetups, events, and job shadowing
