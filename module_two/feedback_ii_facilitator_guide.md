| Opening (5 mins)                                | Facilitator introduces the session and using slide 3 says: **"Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?"** Then discuss answers as a whole group to solicit 2-3 answers from students, cold calling if necessary. Switch to slide 4 to discuss objectives and deliverable. Make sure to send out the [template for their deliverable guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md) in their Slack channels. Then say: **"Last module, we focused on giving written feedback. Today, we'll discuss techniques for providing feedback in a face-to-face conversation."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Students respond when called on                                                            |
| Review (15 mins)                                | Facilitator switches to slide 6 and says: **"What do we mean by intent and impact? The intent is the purpose behind the giver's message, but it may not always align with its impact, which is how the receiver is affected by the message, in conversation. Turn and talk to the person next to you to discuss how intent and impact may function differently in a verbal conversation compared to written feedback? What are some norms you might want to set when having an in-person feedback conversation in order to more fully align your intent with your impact?"** Provide groups with 5 minutes for their turn & talk. After the 5 minutes is over, ask for volunteers from 2-3 groups to share out what they discussed. Then, switch to slide 7 and say: **"Now let's review blind spots, which are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include your facial expressions, your tone of voice, your behavior patterns. And we should also be aware of how both our positive and negative bias can affect our ability to give feedback. When we feel overly positive towards someone, we may refrain from giving needed constructive feedback, but when we feel negative bias towards someone, we may be overly critical."** Then cold call or ask for responses on **" What might blind spots look like in conversation? How does a certain blind spot affect the impact of the message? How can you be more aware of your blind spots?"**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students participate in turn and talk discussions; they respond with answers when prompted |
| Communicating Feedback in Conversation (5 mins) | Facilitator moves to Slide 8 and says: **"As you get ready to conduct a feedback conversation, think about what feedback you need and be prepared to ask for it. Prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. Remember that the 3 types of feedback are *appreciation, coaching,* and *evaluation.* What do these 3 types look like again?"** Cold call or answer raised hands. Student answers should sound like: *appreciation -- thanks/praise to partners for something they did well;* *coaching -- what a partner could improve on to be even stronger in the next project;* *evaluation -- comparing your partner's performance to a set of standards like a rubric.* Say: **"A helpful way to conduct a feedback conversation is to use this template in which you'll have an *open,* a *body,* and a *close.* You start with the *opening* as the introduction to the conversation and how to get aligned with expectations. Define the purpose of the conversation -- *What kind of feedback are we discussing? What does the giver want to give me? Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?* Then, move to the *body* of the conversation in which you and your partner(s) engage in a two-way exchange of information. To be successful with this, you need to make sure that you're using *active listening* and *asserting yourself* when necessary. You should also *manage the conversation process,* which means being aware of how you're reacting to the feedback -- and stopping the conversation if necessary. It's perfectly acceptable to say, 'I can't have this conversation right now. Let's pause it and come back to it at this later time.' When you do come back to the conversation, focus on *problem-solving* and finding the actionable pieces of the feedback. Finally, *close* the conversation by committing to those action steps."** Pause for questions, and then ask **"What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?"** to see what students say.            | Students listen, provide responses when called on                                          |
| Nonviolent Communication Framework (5 mins)     | Facilitator switches to slide 9 and says: **"In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the Nonviolent Communication Framework in order to use our natural compassion when communicating with each other. This framework is similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in Learning to Pair in Module One. The Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more mindful in your communication with others."** Ask the whole group: **"What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like?"** Call on raised hands to solicit answers like *active listening, paying attention, repeating back what you've heard, etc.* Say: **"Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet."** Switch to slide 10 and read the list on the slide. Switch to slide 11 and say: **"Instead, Nonviolent Communication asks you to integrate consciousness through empathy and awareness; using language to create connection rather than distance; communicate through balancing asking and listening; and being aware of your means of influence through sharing your 'power' rather than using your 'power' against someone else."** Switch to slide 12 and then switch through slides 13-16 as you introduce each piece of the framework and say: **"The NVC Framework follows these steps: *observations,* which are facts without judgments; *feelings,* which are harder to express than you might think. If you find yourself using 'that,' 'like,' or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling. You'll follow that with *needs* -- what do you need to move forward? You'll need to reflect on your feelings first and then use positive language and make your needs clear. Finally, make your requests by expressing them clearly and asking for a reflection. All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have the feedback conversation to clarify your points."** |                                                                                            |
| NVC Turn & Talk (7 mins)                        | Facilitator switches to slide 17 and instructs students to get into pairs to turn and talk about the following scenarios and their alternatives. Say: **"For each scenario, discuss the alternatives and what could be a blind spot here? How do you feel about these alternatives? Would you say anything different to try to realign intent and impact more?"** Walk around the room to observe student answers and help them stay on task. After 5 minutes, call on 2-3 groups to share their assessments on the different statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Students find partners and have discussion.                                                |
| Switchtracking (5 mins)                         | Facilitator switches to slide 18 and says: **"Now even with our best intentions, we know that the impact might be different. The idea of Switchtracking illustrates this. We often experience relationship triggers during a feedback conversation because of the way the other person delivers the feedback, and switchtracking occurs when we stop listening to what the person is saying and instead focus on our issues with the person. Here's what it looks like --"** Walk through the steps in the slide and say: **"Suddenly, neither of you are on the same page, and the feedback isn't getting heard."** Switch to slide 19 and read what it says, highlighting the need to manage the conversation as was mentioned earlier. Switch to slide 20 and discuss the scenario by calling on students to answer the questions about the two topics being discussed and how they could get the conversation back on track.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students listen and contribute answers when prompted.                                      |
| Small Group Discussions (8 mins)                | Facilitator switches to slide 21 and tells students to get into small groups to discuss the scenario on the slide. Walk around the room to observe student discussions and help them stay on task. After 6 minutes of discussion, bring the class back together and call on 2-3 groups to share their takeaways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students get into groups and participate in discussions.                                   |
| Feedback Conversation Prep (5 mins)             | Facilitator switches to slide 23 and says: **"Now, prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations. Back End will prepare to give feedback to your Bike Share teammates while Front End will prepare to give feedback to your Game Time partners. Spend time now reflecting on any key points you'd like to bring up, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from your teammates. Make a plan to schedule the conversation and during that conversation, follow the Open-Body-Close format for this conversation, and ask clarifying questions. Finally, create a plan for follow-up -- this is one conversation on how the project went, but consider any conversations you may want to have after taking time to absorb the feedback."** Give students time to think through these things in their notebooks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Students brainstorm in their notebooks                                                     |
| Final Reflection/Closing (5 mins)               | Facilitator switches to the final slide and says: **"As you prepare to give your feedback, reflect on these questions as well: What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? In a year from now, if you’re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?"** Remind students about the deliverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Students continue to reflect in their journals                                             |
