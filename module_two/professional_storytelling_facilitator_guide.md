| Opening (5 mins)                 | Using Slide 3, introduce the objectives and deliverable for the session. Then, using Slide 4, say: **"In Module One, we dove into exploring who we are through discussions of our working styles (where we fall on the introversion/extroversion spectrum), our strengths, and the lenses and identities through which we see the world. In this session, we'll continue to build on this self-awareness to lend to our professional stories. From your professional story, we'll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more. We are all inherent storytellers, and the aim of today's session is to expand on your professional story and turn it into a compelling narrative."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Students follow along, ask questions when needed                |
| Discuss Storytelling (20 mins)   | Using Slide 6 through 8, say: **"Our lives are made up of stories -- they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you. One disclaimer -- when we say 'story,' we don't mean something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring. To review, the three questions that are the basis of telling your story: *Who are you?, Why are you here?, What's next?* Then, solicit responses from students about what elements make up a compelling story. Some possible answers: *cause and effect; beginning, middle, and end; journey for the main character; conflict and resolution; a consistent theme; etc.* Then, say: **"Your story is one of *transition,* which is a story that has a turning point for you, and listeners can relate to that. These stories are inherently interesting as they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition."** Then, you'll tell 2 different versions of your own professional story. You can use Allison's if you'd like (it's on the markdown), or you can tell your professional story, which will probably be more meaningful. Say that you'll tell one story first -- in this story, you'll give a recap of your resume without much extra detail. Then pause and say: **"What elements were in this story?"** Cold call on students or call on raised hands. Possible answers: *there was a logical sequence of events, etc.* Then say that you'll tell another version of a story; in this story, you'll walk through your professional story focused more on your values and include information about setbacks that helped you define your longterm goals. Then pause and say: **"What elements were in this story?"** Cold call on students or call on raised hands. Possible answers: *there is a theme; we get a sense of who you are; we can relate to you as a character; etc.* Then ask, **"Which story is more compelling?"** Students will most likely say story #2. Say: **"Even though story #2 is more compelling, when we're asked to talk about ourselves, we tend to tell story #1 and we retell our resumes, which is not a very interesting story. Bottom line, your story should be more focused on who you are as a person and the values that drive you. It's also important to mention the parts of your story that make you vulnerable because these are the parts that listeners will most relate to themselves. It will make you memorable to the people you talk with."**  | Students follow along and participate in discussion             |
| Individual Practice (10-15 mins) | Using Slide 9, instruct students to spend 10 minutes (you can give them up to 15 minutes) crafting a draft of their story. The slide provides some prompts for them to consider as they write their draft. Instruct students that they can use their journals or computers for the drafting. You can circulate the room to answer questions and ensure students are on task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Students write their drafts independently.                      |
| Feedback Groups (15-20 mins)     | Using Slide 10, instruct students to get into groups to share their stories with each other and provide feedback to each other. Remind them to provide both appreciation and coaching feedback and that the feedback should be *specific, actionable,* and *kind.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Students participate in discussion with their groups.           |
