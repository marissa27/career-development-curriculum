| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| This session takes places in Clarke Hall | Students should have their laptops. You'll need your laptop to show slides | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZxwdADE5YeyRl_mHAfcQW25QgLSALHo_iKu7eRLLfgg/edit?usp=sharing) |

### Before the Session

* Make copies of the [Flower Exercise 1-pager](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf) for everyone in the session
* Post the [student worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) in the cohorts' channels prior to the session beginning. Instruct students to make a copy of the worksheets so that they can complete them during the session.

### Session Structure

* [Student Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Student Worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing)

**Note:** This session is structured as a workshop. Students are introduced to each part of the exercise and are given time to start their brainstorming on the worksheets (linked above), but there is only enough time in the session for students to start this process. They are meant to continue reflecting on their own time outside of the session.

| Opening (8 mins)  | Using Slide 3, introduce the objectives for the session and the recommended deliverable, which is for students to complete the Flower Exercise graphic organizer. Pass the copies around the room so that students can take one. Switch to Slide 4 and say: **"Today we're going to talk through the Flower Exercise from the book *What Color is Your Parachute?,* a premiere job searching book. It has a stupid name, but the exercise is highly effective as a way to help you analyze your goals and greatest priorities to find a career path that you truly love, which is why you've come to Turing. The Flower Exercise is designed to help you move through 3 stages -- the brain dump stage to organize your thoughts using these worksheets.** [Post the worksheets in the cohorts' channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) **After that, the synthesis stage is where you'll summarize the findings in your brain dump. Finally, the prioritization stage will help narrow down what's most important to you from your synthesis. The results from your prioritization stage are what should go on your finished Flower page. The brain dump stage is what we'll focus on in today's session."** Switch to Slide 6 and say: **"How have you answered the question 'what do you do?' in the past?"** Cold call or solicit responses from 2-3 students before you click to the next block of text on the slide. You'll most likely get responses about how students defined themselves in terms of their roles ("I'm a teacher," "I'm a construction worker," "I'm a graphic designer," etc.). Say: **"You probably talked about your role, but you're so much more than that."** Switch to Slide 7 and say: **"Try answering that question with 'I'm a person who...' and remember all your talents, strengths, skills, experiences, and goals that make up who you are as a professional."** Switch to Slide 8 and say: **"The Flower Exercise is called that because it looks like a flower on the final page with its 7 different areas from which you can describe yourself and your career goals."** Read the 7 areas from the slide and say: **"We'll spend a few minutes on each of these areas today and have some time for you to go through the worksheets, but you won't have enough time to finish each part during the session. You should continue this work outside of today's session to help you as you start with your job search."**  | Students take graphic organizer, make copies of the Google Docs worksheets |
| Petal 1 (6 mins)  | Using Slide 10, say: **"Start with what you know. You are a person who knows many things from your previous careers and experiences. Think about what you'd still like to learn. Now start with the first worksheet in the Google Doc and list what you know from previous jobs, from other experiences besides work, what industries you'd like to enter and learn from, and anything else you'd like to learn in the future."** Provide students with about 5 minutes to work on the worksheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Students work on the first worksheet on their laptops                      |

You bring with you a lot of skills to this new career, and the exercise here for you to tease out what those skills are through a longer series of steps. You'll write a short story about a goal that you worked to achieve -- it doesn't necessarily have to do with your job -- but you'll want to describe challenges that you encountered between you and this goal and how you overcame them to accomplish your goal. You'll then look through your story to pull out specific skills that you used to accomplish that goal. From there, you'll divide your skills into people skills, skills with data, and skills with things. Then, decide which are your top skills and synthesize those. You may want to write more than one story -- the book actually recommends that you write 7 total -- to see the trends that emerge about the skills you use most often."** Tell the students two stories to provide them with examples. One story is from the book's author in which he describes that he wanted to take a family vacation but couldn't afford for his family to stay in hotels. So he decided to rig his car into a camper; he didn't know how to do that, so he read about it, bought the necessary tools, and turned his car into a camper. He was able to have a great vacation with his family and estimated that he saved $1200 on hotel bills. Say: **"What kind of skills did he use to accomplish his goal?"** Call on 1-2 students to answer the question. Then, describe a story about yourself when you sought to reach a goal and what you did to accomplish that goal and what kind of skills it entailed. Call on 1-2 students to describe the skills you used to accomplish your goal. Then say: **"I didn't provide you space for the story itself; you can write that out in your journals or make space on the Google Doc.

| Petal 7 (6 mins)  | Using Slide 16, say: **"Finally, this petal will have you examine your goals and how you might define the mission or purpose you have in life. This reflection will probably take you the longest as it's important to reflect on the values and ideals that drive your life and work to align them as much as possible.

| Closing (4 mins)  | Using Slide 18, remind students that the end goal of this exercise is to complete their 1-pager with their highest priorities. Call on 1-2 students to share anything they'd learned about themselves in the session OR how they think they can apply the exercise to their job search. I also like to end with this anecdote: **"The Flower Exercise is as effective as you make it. 1608-BE alum Molly Brown used it to make her decision on her first job offer after graduating from Turing. She was trying to decide between 3 offers -- an offer in Denver, an offer in Dallas, and an offer in Santa Barbara. She first thought she might take the Denver job because she was from here, her family and friends were here, and she wouldn't have to move. It seemed like an easy enough decision. But then she consulted what she'd written about in her Flower Exercise and looking over her values, goals, and priorities, she realized that her dream job was the one in Santa Barbara. So she took the leap and accepted the job in Santa Barbara to fully realize the dream that she'd come to Turing to fulfill. Again, you're here to find the career that you love. This exercise can help you do that."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students answer questions, ask any remaining questions                     |
