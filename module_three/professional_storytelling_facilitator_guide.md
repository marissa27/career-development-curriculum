| Opening (3 mins)                              | Introduce M3 professional development by [displaying this page](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/README.md) and quickly walk through the different sessions, deliverables, and expectations for PD this module. Then, using Slide 3, introduce the objectives and expected deliverables for the session. Allow for a few student questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Ask questions if needed                                                                                                 |
| Storytelling Recap (12 mins)                  | Using Slide 5, say: **"As we've discussed, our lives are made up of stories -- they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you. To review, these three questions are the basis of telling your story: Who are you? (as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer) Why are you here? (Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field) What's next? (Where do you see yourself going in this career?)."** Switch to Slide 6 and say: **"Review your story draft from last module for 2 minutes and then pair up with a partner to share a brief version of your professional story, including what's next for you in this career. Each person will get 1.5 minutes to share their stories and then switch. We will do 2 rounds of this practice total, so you'll have 2 different partners to practice with."** After providing students with 2 minutes to review their story, instruct them to find partners and begin the exercise. Use a timer to let students know when to switch and also when to find new partners.  | Students participate in storytelling practice                                                                           |
| Resumes: Intro & Turn & Talk (8 mins)         | Using Slide 8, introduce how students will restructure their resumes. Say: **"You've written a resume before, but now you'll write a completely new one for your new career, focusing on telling your career transition story and highlighting your new skills and projects."** Switch to Slide 9 and say: **"Let's see what this looks like in some alumni example resumes. Turn and talk to the person next to you and pick out 2-3 resumes to look at and discuss. These are linked in the markdown. Think about what sticks out to you as effective in these resumes and what you might do differently."** Provide students with 6 minutes for the Turn & Talk, then ask students for takeaways as a whole group: **"What are your takeaways from the resumes you discussed with your partner?"**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Students partner up to discuss resumes; students ask questions                                                          |
| Resumes: Layout & Student Work time (16 mins) | Using Slide 10, introduce tools available for students to use to create different layouts for their resumes. Then, walk through Slides 11-16 to show the different parts of their resume that should be included and why. On Slide 12, say: **"A common question students ask is 'do I need a summary?' The answer is yes. Because you are new to this field, and your experience probably doesnâ€™t match up with the positions you are applying for. So, you need to tell the story of why you are entering this field and applying to positions in software development."** Then using Slide 17, say: **"Start with creating a longform master copy of your resume that you can draw from each time you create a tailored version."** Instruct students to take 10 minutes to work on their resume and explore the different layout tools discussed earlier. Remind students that they'll need to have a working draft to discuss during the Resume Review workshop during Week 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Students ask questions, work on their resume drafts                                                                     |
| Cover Letters (16 mins)                       | Using Slide 19, introduce cover letters and say: **"Cover letters are also an important tool in telling your story and illustrating your personality before you meet with someone face-to-face."** Using Slides 20 - 22, discuss the template that a cover letter should follow. Then open the link on Slide 23 and read Tommasina's example cover letter aloud to the whole group and solicit questions of what stands out about the cover letter and what story is she telling? Cold call on students or call on raised hands. A good point to bring up here is how Tommasina tells a story about herself as an activist in a cover letter to a company that appreciates activism. Using Slide 24, emphasize the other key points listed and mention with the second point that students will be completing personal projects this module and should think about how the projects they create can relate to companies that they're interested in. Using Slide 25, provide students with 8 minutes to create a master cover letter template and to focus on figuring out 2-3 hooks they could use to uniquely describe themselves and their personalities. See if students have any questions, circulate the room to ensure they're on task. If there's time, you can see if any students want to share the hooks they've come up with.                                                                               | Students ask questions, participate in discussion about cover letter example, and build out their cover letter template |
| Intro to Turing Portfolios (5 mins)           | Using Slide 27, say: **"The last piece you'll build this module to tell your professional story to potential employers is the Turing alumni portfolio, which you will create on our website and upload at turing.io/alumni. As you fill out your Turing portfolio, think about how you want to present yourself."** Read through the must-haves listed on the slide and show examples from the site to illustrate what these look like. Say: **"You should have received an email invitation today to create your account. If you don't see that invitation, please check your spam folder. There are a few bugs in the site, and it may give you some trouble publishing it. One thing you should make sure to do is not use Chrome -- use Safari or Firefox. If you have other questions about the site, reach out to Kayt.Please log into your account right now and update your account with your professional headshot."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students ask questions if needed                                                                                        |
| Closing (2 mins)                              | Using Slide 29, introduce the next PD session on the Flower Exercise the book *What Color is Your Parachute?* Say: **"This exercise is all about diving into different aspects of your character, goals, and values to more fully understand what you're looking for in this new career. It will help inform your resume and the research you do on different companies."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Students ask questions if needed                                                                                        |
