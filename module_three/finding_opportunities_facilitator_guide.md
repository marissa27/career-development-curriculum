| Hook (5 mins)                  | Using Slide 3, ask students to think about their last job search and the strategies that they used in it. Have them turn and talk to the person next to them to share what was successful about those strategies and what strategies were not successful. Provide them with 4 minutes for the turn and talk, then call them back together, and cold call on 2-3 students to share both what wasn't successful and what was in their previous job searches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Students participate in turn and talk                                     |
| Opening (3 mins)               | Building off of the conversation and using Slide 4, introduce the objectives of the session, and say: **"Today, we'll talk about how to find opportunities for your job search that don't rely on job postings so that you can more quickly make connections and find the opportunities that are right for you." Switch to Slide 6 and say: **"As you heard from us already as we talk about outreach and networking, we want you to look beyond job postings you find online because this industry thrives on building relationships. The reason for this is that when you make contact with someone at a company that you're interested in, you are more likely to be referred for that position than from an application alone."** Switch to Slide 7 and say: **"So instead, we want to focus on finding opportunities through seeking out people and companies instead of job postings. And you should focus on researching companies and contacts that align with the work you want to do -- as you've discovered through your Flower Exercise brainstorming."** Switch to Slide 8 and say: **"We'll look at different tools that will help you connect with companies and people, but first we need to set up a system to keep track of your research and work in this job search."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students listen, take notes, etc.                                         |
| Job Tracking Systems (15 mins) | Using Slide 9, say: **"You're expected to use some kind of system for your job search, and you'll be asked about it during your Module 4 portfolio to describe how you're using this job tracking system, so you'll want to start that process now. We'll discuss 2 specific tools you can use, but the important thing is finding a system that works for you."** Using Slide 10 and showing [this example Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/LzGvHxUu/fa8b0714343186085b06d893d8177c94/allison-job-tracker-example), say: **"Trello is an effective tool for tracking your job search. If you haven't used Trello before, it's free to sign up. Here is a [blog post](https://blog.trello.com/using-trello-for-a-job-search-less-stress-more-process) about how you can use it for your job search."** Using Slide 11, say: **"Another effective system is Jobtrack.io, which allows you to track where you are in the process with any given company, upload versions of your resume and cover letter, store research intuitively using its Chrome extension, and aggregate data on your job search progress. There's a [video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SPY5CbL5hQj7JDxGrAnCMSkIgmLG78n/view) will help you get set up."** Provide students with 10 minutes to explore either tool and get it set up to start tracking their research, leads, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Students choose the job tracking system they want to use and set it up.   |
| Exploring Tools (35 mins)      | Using Slides 13 and 14, say: **"Meetup.com is not only an effective tool to find networking events, but it's also a great way to start building connections. Use the groups to find out who is active in these meetups, the organizers, and who is attending upcoming events. Then start your research -- do any of them work at companies or do the kind of work you'd like to be doing?"** Show students how to use meetup.com for this purpose, and then provide students with 5-7 minutes to explore meetup.com and start using it to find contacts and even more meetups to attend to meet them. Using Slides 15, 16, and 17, say: **"In Module One, we talked about how to use LinkedIn passively in your job search to allow others to find you. Now we'll talk about how to use LinkedIn actively for your job search. You can search for different companies, different skillsets, and see who you can connect with form companies that you're interested in."** Use LinkedIn.com to show students how they can look up different companies and people to connect with. Provide students with 5-7 minutes to explore LinkedIn and add to their job searching system. Using Slide 18, say: **"Don't forget about how Google searches can help you find opportunities as well. Use a search term about something you're interested in, such as 'top tech companies in Denver 2017' or 'top edtech companies in Denver' to find journalist-curated lists that will help you discover potential companies and contacts."** Provide students with 5-7 minutes to do this kind of search and add to their job tracking system. Switch to Slide 19 and say: **"Builtin.com is a great resource for finding out about tech start-ups in a few different cities, including the Denver area. They also have their Built In Brews events every quarter or so."** Provide students with 5-7 minuets to look through Builtin.com to find companies they want to research. Using Slide 20, say: **"Skillful is also a great organization to help you find out about companies by going to the training section on LinkedIn to find more companies that are hiring -- not to apply to the jobs through LinkedIn but to find out about the companies."** Using Slide 21, say: **"Here are a few other resources you should check out to find out about opportunities."** | Students follow along, participate with the different tools when prompted |
| Closing (2 mins)               | Using Slide 23, close the session by reminding students that keeping their job search organized will make their job search go much more quickly and efficiently. They should remember to keep as detailed notes/contact information as possible. Provide a minute or two for questions if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students ask questions if needed                                          |
