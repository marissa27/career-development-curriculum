# Module Three Resume Review Guidelines (Week Three)

## Facilitator Guide

**Directions for Coaches:** Please use these guidelines to structure your resume review workshops with Module 3 students during Week 3 of the module.

| Timing | Facilitator Actions | Participant Actions |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before Session | **Lead Facilitator** should divide up the number of M3 students (mixed across both programs) into groups of 4-5 students and assign them to the staff coaches. Send out a Slack message to the coaches with the assigned groups ahead of the scheduled workshop along with the directions found in this markdown. Send a message to students ahead of the workshop letting them know they should either have printed copies (let them know how many for their group) or an active link of their resume to share with their groups. Send them also the spreadsheet of their groups, their workshop time, and the location; in the message, say: **"In your groups, you will each have 10 minutes to be workshopped. You'll share your story, condensed to 2 minutes, as well as your resume, and you'll receive feedback from the group. There will also be a few additional minutes for your group to look at exemplar resume examples, which are linked in the markdown, and ask questions of your coach and group. Groups who are workshopped in the first 45 min. round will then work on incorporating feedback into their resume drafts during the second 45 minutes as well as working on their Turing portfolios. Groups who are workshopped second should spend the first 45 minutes practicing their stories, ensuring that their resumes are ready to be presented, and working on their Turing portfolios."** **Note:** Make sure that coaches know that if they have less than 4 people in their groups, they will have more time to discuss additional resources with their groups (linked in this markdown) as well as additional questions.  | N/A |
| Group #1 Breakout - 45 mins. | **Lead Facilitator:** Direct coaches to break out with their first groups (locations can be decided on ahead of time and can include either of the M3 classrooms, a pairing area, Clarke Hall, or the Vault) and follow this timeframe: 1. Intros (go around and say your name and mod) and decide on order (2 mins.) 2. Each Student presents for 10 mins: 2 mins. pitch of their professional story; 2-3 mins. of feedback; each person in the group should provide 1 piece of appreciative feedback and 1 piece of coaching feedback; Present resume and get feedback from coach and group (5 mins); again, 1 piece of appreciative feedback, 1 piece of coaching feedback. 3. Remaining time: Discuss the additional resources linked in this markdown and any additional Q&A. **Coaches:** As your groups finish the workshop, remind them that they should update their resumes to be ready for their Turing portfolio and that as they go into their job shadowing assignment in Week 4, they should be prepared to share their stories with the professionals they meet. Also, please discuss expectations for job shadowing (see below) | Students move to their respective groups. If they are in the second group, they should work on their story, resume, and Turing portfolio. |
| Group #2 Breakout - 45 mins. | Coaches should follow the same timeframe as that listed above. **Coaches:** As your groups finish the workshop, remind them that they should update their resumes to be ready for their Turing portfolio and that as they go into their job shadowing assignment in Week 4, they should be prepared to share their stories with the professionals they meet. Also, please discuss expectations for job shadowing (see below) | Students move to their respective groups. If they are done being workshopped, they should work on updating their resume and Turing portfolio. |

## Job Shadow Reminders
Remind students about job shadowing, including professional expectations, such as:
* Keep your phones off/out of reach 
* Don't drink alcohol prior to the shadow
* Dress professionally -- doesn't need to be overly dressy, focus on business casual
* Come prepared with questions

Read this feedback we've gotten from an alum at Ibotta to your students: 
```As a Turing grad who benefitted greatly from shadowing, it's a pleasure to be able to hopefully provide the same benefit to Turing students who shadow me at Ibotta. I have a bit of feedback for future shadowing students: It's best not to consume anything before the shadowing that might cause one's breath to smell like alcohol. If it's not alcohol, then sometimes chewing tobacco can cause this odor. When you're sitting right next to someone you're shadowing, they will smell it. So that's something Turing students might want to be aware of before they shadow. Another thing is that it's best not to check your phone while the person you're shadowing is trying to show you things. It's rude and shows that you're unengaged during time that the person has taken out of their day to hopefully show you useful stuff. Another thing I'd recommend is for students to come prepared with questions. This is a rare opportunity to learn what life is like outside of Turing, and it's a shame to not take advantage of it. Respectfully asking questions also evidences engagement and interest on the part of the student. I am so glad that Turing offers its students this opportunity, and it was something that I found really useful. I hope this feedback isn't too heavy-handed. Just something I wanted to share with you. Thanks for all that you do, and I hope to get to meet you in person some day soon!```

## For Coaches: What to Look for in a Professional Story
Students have been asked to describe themselves using these 3 guiding questions:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here in this industry?
* Where do you want to go in this industry?

Feedback should include:
* **Appreciation** on what is compelling about the story
* **Coaching** on anything that isn't clear or what could be improved in the storytelling skills area 
* Principles of being specific, actionable, and kind 

## For Coaches: What to Look for in a Resume
Students were given these guidelines for creating an effective resume:
* **Professional story** at the top; About 3-4 sentences about their transition into software development. Look for:
 	* Who are they: As a software developer? Team member? Career changer? Individual?
 	* How they got here: Why software development? Why Turing? Why now?
 	* Whatâ€™s Next: What do they hope to accomplish? What are they looking to gain from this experience? 
* Followed by **skills**:
  * Listing of languages, frameworks, testing, and tool. Transferable skills should be in this section as well
* Followed by **projects**: Highlighting 2-3 favorite projects; Some things to look for:
	 * What does your application do? What problem does it solve? 
	 * Who is it built for? What does it allow the user to do? 
 	* What is the high level overview of the project? 
 	* What technologies did you use? Highlighting API's, frameworks, and languages
 	* In what period of time was it built?
 	* What was their role in the project?
  * Clickable GitHub repo and any applicable links
* Followed by **experience:**
  * Titled as "Experience" rather than "Employment"
	 * Format should start with title followed by company
	 * Dates should be used
	 * Bullet points (3-5 per organization) should be used & focused on the value that was brought to the organization rather than the individual tasks performed
	* Turing can fall under experience or education 
* Followed by **education (if applicable)**

Check for:
  * Layout -- is it easily readable? Is it interesting/eye-catching?
  * Organization -- can you tell clearly what the sections are telling you?
  * Communication skills -- are there typos? Is the punctuation correct?

**Prompting Questions:**
* What makes this an effective resume?
* What makes a resume memorable? 
* Consider making a long-form resume that includes as much information as you want. How would you cut it down 1 page for specific positions? What should you always include? What can you leave out?
* How can you ensure that your resume fully represents you?
