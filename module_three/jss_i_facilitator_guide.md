| Opening (5 mins)                                      | Using slide 3, read the questions listed and say: **"Trying to answer all of these questions at once can feel overwhelming, but in this session, we'll discuss how you can pull together all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) to help you answer these questions one by one."** Then switch to slides 4 and 5 to read through the objectives and deliverables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students listen, take notes                                                                 |
| Discuss Priorities (5 mins)                           | Using slide 7, say: **"Start by defining your priorities for the longterm -- what are your priorities for your career? Start with your Flower Exercise -- it forced you to take a deeper dive into what skills, knowledge, and values have informed your professional journey thus far, and we'll build on those reflections to analyze how our new career could provide us with the opportunities we seek."** Then show a scanned version of your own Flower Exercise or you can use [Allison's](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Allison's%20Flower%20Scan.pdf) to pull out some main points and discuss how to use those to create some statements for what kind of career you'd be looking for. On slide 8, Allison's statement is: "I value helping others reach their fullest potential, and my skills in coaching, active listening, and providing feedback ensure that I can be successful in a career that does just that. For my next job search, my priorities are to find a job that combines my passion and knowledge around curriculum-planning to coach others on a wider spectrum, and I also hope to do this work in a way that provides the right work-life balance to allow me to pursue my passion for writing as well." *If you use your own statement, feel free to modify that slide for the session.*  | Students listen, take notes                                                                 |
| You Do: Students Prioritize (5 mins)                  | Using slide 9, instruct students to use their Flower Exercise to list out specific priorities based on their values, skills, and needs for their new career. Circulate the room to ensure everyone is on task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students write independently.                                                               |
| Discuss Priorities II (5 mins.)                       | Using slide 10, say **"Now, let's translate those priorities into day-to-day priorities -- what do you need to find in your first dev job? Break these down into 'Must-Haves' and 'Nice-to-Haves'"** Using the priorities you discussed from the Flower Exercise, break them down into day-to-day priorities, using a t-chart for these two categories on the board. Demonstrate how you would move priorities from the "Must-Have" list to the "Nice-to-Have" list in order to narrow down priorities to the highest one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Students listen, take notes                                                                 |
| You Do: Create Must-Have & Nice-to-Have list (5 mins) | Instruct students to take their priorities from the last exercise and create their own t-chart of "Must-Haves" and "Nice-to-Haves."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Students create their charts and work independently.                                        |
| Pair & Share: Priorities (5 mins)                     | Using slide 11, instruct students to pair up with a partner to share their priorities both for their longterm career and for their "must-haves."

From there, you can plan what you will need to do each month, each week, and each day to keep your job search on track for your deadline."** Give students a brief introduction to their M4 PD Peer Groups -- these will be groups they will meet with each week in Module 4 and they will have a staff coach to help them further their job search goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students listen, take notes                                                                 |
| You Do: Job Search Logistics (8 mins)                 | Using slide 18, instruct students to think about what needs they have in the job search and to fill out the survey that you'll post in their Slack channels for their M4 PD Peer Groups (see maternity leave for details on this survey).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students fill out survey                                                                    |
| Closing (5 mins)                                      | Using slides 20 and 21, recap the same questions that were introduced at the beginning of the session to emphasize how to break down these questions into manageable pieces and remind students about the deliverables they should be completing. With any remaining time, instruct students to work on their deliverables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Students work on their deliverables                                                         |
