Structure:

* Expertise (20 mins)
* Future Contributions (25 mins)
* Job search logistics (10 mins)
* Closing (5 mins)
* Extra time: students can spend time working on their deliverables (potentially 10 mins)

### Opening
This job search brings up a lot of questions:

* What do you want to do?
	* What do you want from your career in the longterm?
	* On a daily basis? 
* What areas do you consider your expertise?
	* How do your current projects show that?
* How will you contribute to the software industry in the future?
	* What is in your comfort zone and toolbox already?
	* How will you push yourself?
* Logistics:
	* When do you need a job by? 
	* What steps do you need to take to secure that job?

Trying to answer all of these questions at once can feel overwhelming, but in this session, we'll discuss how you can pull together all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) to help you answer these questions one by one.

### Objectives
* Identify your top priorities in your job search
* Identify your industry expertise at this point in the program
* Describe how you'd like to contribute to the software industry and how you'll pursue these ideas in your job search
* Decide when you will need to complete your job search and what steps are needed to make that happen

### Deliverables
* Complete your resume edits
* Complete your Turing portfolio
* Complete PD Peer Groups Survey

### Decide on Priorities: What do you want to do (longterm)? 
The Flower Exercise forced you to take a deeper dive into what skills, knowledge, and values have informed your professional journey thus far, and we'll build on those reflections to analyze how our career could provide us with the opportunities we seek. 

How can you do that? Start by looking at your completed Flower Exercise. What bullet points stick out to you as most important in describing who you are? How can you take the most important bullets and combine them into a career you love?

**I Do:** Allison will model how she might create a professional summary about herself using [her Flower Exercise](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Allison's%20Flower%20Scan.pdf):

* I value helping others reach their fullest potential, and my skills in coaching, active listening, and providing feedback ensure that I can be successful in a career that does just that. For my next job search, my priorities are to find a job that combines my passion and knowledge around curriculum-planning to coach others on a wider spectrum, and I also hope to do this work in a way that provides the right work-life balance to allow me to pursue my passion for writing as well. 

### Your Turn
**Write:** Spend five minutes analyzing your Flower Exercise and list your biggest priorities in the job search based on what you've discovered. 

Priorities could include: 

* Physical location
* Industry
* Size of company
* Team culture
* Diversity makeup
* Technologies
* Flexibility
* Salary amount
* Types of benefits
* Mentorship

### Decide on Priorities: What do you want to do (on a daily basis)?
Using what you just discussed, think about what this can look like in a day-to-day job. Then create two columns, labelled "Must-Have" and "Nice-To-Have":

* If you could only have five of those things, which five would it be?
* Move the rest to the "Nice-to-Have" list
* If you could only have one of the things in your list of five, which would it be?
* Prioritize based on how you narrowed it down and identify why they are prioritized in this order

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else to share your priorities, both for your longterm career and your "must-haves." Your partner will repeat back to you what they heard you say in order to convey how clear this list is. Do your partner's "must-haves" align with their goals and career trajectory? 

### Show Your Expertise: Your Projects & Portfolio
You've completed almost three out of four modules of this program, and you've made A LOT of progress -- *you're ready to share this expertise with the world!* The first way you'll do this is through your [Turing portfolio](turing.io/alumni). You'll discuss this portfolio with your instructors during your end-of-module portfolio review. This is an excellent opportunity to:

* Own the progress that you've made and your expertise
* Practice talking about yourself
* Practice describing a project

**You Do:** Prepare to defend your Turing portfolio.  Reflect on the projects you've worked on and which specific project you've chosen to highlight on your Turing portfolio.

* What is your area of expertise (where are you strongest)?
* Why did you pick this particular project?
* How does it show what you know?
* How could you describe this project to a potential employer in a synthesized way?

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with a new partner to discuss your expertise and present your project and portfolio as though you are talking to a potential employer. Your partner will give you feedback on how well they understood your project and what you are an expert in. 

### Future Contributions: Claim Your Place in the Industry
By attending this program, you are making a place for yourself in the software industry, and now that you're finishing the program soon, you can claim that place even more fully. Consider: what ways will you add your unique voice to the industry in the future? Some things you can think about in regards to this:

* Networking (attending events and conferences to make connections; joining a networking group)
* Speaking (meetups, conference talks)
* Blogging
* Social media
* Contributing to open source
* Starting your own company
* Mentoring
* Volunteering to teach others to code
* Participating in hackathons

**You Do:**
* Create a list of the ways in which you already feel comfortable contributing to the industry -- what is already in your wheelhouse to complete? What are you currently doing?
* Now think about something either from the above list or something that isn't listed that makes you uncomfortable. How can you push yourself to try that activity despite the discomfort you may feel? How might it be rewarding for you? 

**Small Group Discussion:** Form a group of 3-4 people and discuss 1 thing each of you can comfortably do in the industry as well as 1 thing that each of you would need to push yourself to try. Then discuss:
* Why might it be important to contribute to the industry outside of writing code for your job? 
* How could this help you with your job search?
* How could you seek out resources to help you with the parts that make you uncomfortable? 

### Job Search Logistics: Get Practical
Finally, let's think about what you need from the job search in terms of how quickly you need a job and what steps you will take to make that happen. 

Effective job searches take some backwards planning, starting with analyzing what is at stake in your job search. Think about your financial situation and any upcoming activities in your life outside of looking for a job to answer the question:

* When do you need to have a job by? 

Work backwards from that date to consider these questions for yourself:

* If I need a job by X date, what do I need to do each month/week/day to make that happen?
* Who will I rely for support? Who will I use for resources? 

### Your Turn
Decide for yourself answers to the above questions, and fill out the survey for Module 4 PD Peer Groups.

### Closing
Create a plan to get your resume and Turing portfolio finished by next week's portfolio review. 

As you finish up Module 3, continue to come back to these questions that we posed at the beginning of the session. Assess how confident you feel to answer any of these as you keep going with your job search:

* What do you want to do?
	* What do you want from your career in the longterm?
	* On a daily basis? 
* What areas do you consider your expertise?
	* How do your current projects show that?
* How will you contribute to the software industry in the future?
	* What is in your comfort zone and toolbox already?
	* How will you push yourself?
* Logistics:
	* When do you need a job by? 
	* What steps do you need to take to secure that job?
