| Opening (5 mins)             | Before starting the session, remind students of their PD deliverables this module (DTR memo, Storytelling reflection, feedback for project partners, Census profile) -- mention that the DTR Memo and reflection should be submitted in the Career Development Repo with a PR and that you'll discuss Census today. Then, show slide 3 and introduce objectives and deliverable. Say: **"This session is about how to use your storytelling skills in different platforms to create your personal brand as a software developer."** Show students the Census interface and say: **"Census is an internal app that functions as a Turing directory. I'll send you an invite to set up your Census profile, and we'd like to see all of these fields filled out although Twitter is optional. This makes it easier for everyone to connect with each other, and Census also links to our internal apps. We will never sell or share your data with anyone."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Students listen, take notes if needed                                    |
| Opening Icebreaker (10 mins) | Switch to slide 4 and say: **"As a follow-up to last week's session where we practiced expressing who we are, we'll do some more practice today focusing on describing ourselves in particular ways and keeping our responses short and to the point. Find a partner to talk with. You'll each have one minute to describe yourselves as a worker -- what kind of worker are you?"** Once students find partners, tell them to decide who will go first and start a timer. Tell them to switch at 1 minute. When the timer goes off, instruct them to find a new partner to now describe themselves in terms of their career transition. Set the timer and tell them to switch at 1 minute. When the timer goes off, say: **"In this last round, you're going to describe yourselves as developers. You may be thinking to yourself 'I'm only in Mod 1, I'm not a developer.' But that's the impostor syndrome talking. You've spent 5 weeks in this program, learning a lot and doing the work of developers. It's time to embrace that identity. You'll now describe yourselves as developers -- what kind of developer are you becoming? How do you see yourself growing as a developer?"** Time the groups again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Students partner off and participate in their 3 rounds of storytelling.  |
| Debrief/Transition (5 mins)  | As students go back to their seats, using slide 5, ask them what was easy or difficult about this practice. Call on raised hands or cold call. Then ask students what details they found sharing about themselves in each scenario; were any of the details consistent across the 3 different scenarios? Then using slide 7, say: **"You all just participated in a form of personal branding. Personal branding is about telling a consistent story about yourself whether in conversation or in online tools."** Switch to Slide 8 and say: **"Today, we'll look at a few of these tools, starting with LinkedIn. This is a platform that was built specifically to be a storytelling tool although many of us use it as a copy of our resume. It can be used for so much more, and we'll explore that today. You can have your computers open to your LinkedIn profile as we go through this today, and if you don't currently have a profile, now is a perfect time to get it set up."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students listen, open laptops                                            |
| LinkedIn Overview (15 mins)  | On Slide 9, mention that with the headline, it doesn't need to be their job title; this is what they want to be known for in the industry. As with the screenshot of Mike Limberg, they can show a story of their career trajectory just in the headline by describing what they did before and what they are doing now. On Slide 10, go through each part of the first look. They can use the headshot that Mike Dao took for them. If they are looking for jobs outside of Denver, they should use that location on their profile now to show up in recruiter searches for that area. Their professional story will go in the summary -- as they keep refining it, they should pay attention to how compelling they can make their opening so that someone will click on "see more." On slide 12, go through what the summary should include, including a call to action -- what should people do once they read your profile? Email you? Look at your GitHub? Then, on slides 13 and 14, discuss how work experience is a great place for more storytelling; it should not look exactly like their resume. They should tell a first-person account of what value they brought to a specific role/company/customer base, etc. They should put Turing under experience to have that show up in their profile earlier, but they should make it clear that they are not staff members. In the description, they should describe the value they are bringing to their projects through the skills they are learning, to their partners, and to the community. On slide 15, instruct students to also list Turing under education to be linked with the rest of the Turing alumni community. On slide 16, mention the importance of their unique URL. Show them how to find it by clicking on the middle of the 3 buttons on the side of their profile, which will take them to a separate screen and provide a space to edit their URL. They should make it their first and last name; if their name is very common, they should use their middle name as well. On slide 17, instruct students to include projects as they continue through the program. Show them on the bottom of the profile where they should add skills and how they can endorse each other on these skills. And if they're interested in pursuing jobs in other countries, they can make their profile in another language. Show students that on their profile screen, those 3 buttons on the top right, the last button will allow them to build a profile in another language. However, they must provide the translations themselves. Finally, on slide 18, instruct students to use LinkedIn to build their network. They should focus on *quality* connections over *quantity* -- they should know all of their connections in a personal or professional capacity. They should engage with their network, responding to their connections' posts and posting their own updates.   | Students follow along, ask questions as needed                           |
| Twitter (5 mins)             | Using slide 19, introduce Twitter and say: **"We will highly encourage you to use Twitter because many people in the developer community are on Twitter, and it's a very effective way to be part of the conversation and build your brand."** Switch to slide 20 to discuss what their profiles should look like -- what do they notice about Emily Freeman's profile? What do they learn about her story? Cold call or call on raised hands. Mention that the professional headshot should be the same as their LinkedIn and other branding sites. Switch to slide 21 and say: **"The purpose of Twitter is to have conversations. These conversations should be conducted in a professional and respectful way, but you can and should feel free to express your whole self on Twitter as well, including personal opinions about different issues. Sonia Gupta is a great example of someone who uses Twitter in an intentional way -- she even got her first job post-Turing by starting a conversation with the CEO of Tokken on Twitter."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Students follow along, ask questions as needed                           |
| GitHub (5 mins)              | Using slide 22, discuss how students all have a GitHub but they should be using it to their branding advantage; include a headshot and call to action -- email address, link to personal site, etc. Employers will look at your GitHub, so as you go through the program, make sure to refactor your code and update ReadMes as you go along. Don't delete old projects even as you improve -- you want to show potential employers your full growth and depth of knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students follow along, ask questions as needed                           |
| Stack Overflow (5 mins)      | Using slide 23, ask students to raise their hands if they've used Stack Overflow. Most will.
