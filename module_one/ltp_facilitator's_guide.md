| Opening (8 mins)                               | Facilitator introduces the session: **"You're starting your first paired project at Turing, and this session will discuss how to make that pairing successful."** Show slide 4 and say: **"Pairing is a best practice in the industry and we want to not only prepare you for that, but you will also learn more from pairing with others while you're at Turing."** Switch to slide 5 and introduce the objectives for the session and explain that they'll need to complete 1 DTR Memo from one of their paired projects to turn in at the end of the module although they *should* complete a DTR Memo every time they pair with someone. Then, switch to slide 6 and ask students to **"Think about a time when you've worked in a group setting, maybe at work, in school, or a volunteer context; what was successful about these team projects? What wasn't successful about them? Turn & Talk to the person next to you to share your experience."** Students should talk for about 4-5 mins total. Then, cold call/solicit responses from 2 students to ask what circumstances made a group project successful, what made them unsuccessful. Use these answers to make any connections with how key expectation-setting is and what we'll discuss in the session today...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students turn and talk about their past group project experiences when directed                      |
| Discuss types of pair programming (6 mins)     | Facilitator switches to slide 8 and says **"But first, let's discuss what pair programming can look like in practice. The first is Driver-Navigator; this is when you are pairing side-by-side on the same machine. The driver is typing the code while the navigator dictates what the driver should type. Each of those roles helps you learn specific skills -- the driver is learning muscle memory and keyboard shortcuts while the navigator works on their ability to think and discuss code aloud. You should make sure to switch these roles often so that both partners get practice with each set of skills."** Cold Call on a student: **"What are potential pitfalls when using Driver-Navigator?"** Potential answers: driver could decide to input their own ideas, navigator or driver aren't listening to each other, navigator stops paying attention, etc. Move to next type and say **"The next type of pair programming is Ping Pong Pairing. This kind of pairing can be in person or remote as you and your partner are using your own machine during this pairing. Just like with a game of ping pong, you'll pass code back and forth to each other with one partner completing something like a test and then passes it over to their partner to try out and make sure it can pass. This is how you can get both pairs of eyes on a feature and receive feedback before you merge the code. Using Pull Requests and effective Git workflow will be essential for success in this type of pairing."** Cold Call on a student: **"What are potential pitfalls when using Ping Pong Pairing?"** Potential answers: not agreeing on the expectations for a piece of code and what kind of feedback you're looking for, miscommunication about deadlines or the feedback process, etc. Move on to the last type of pair programming and say: **"The last type of pair programming is Remote or Distributed pairing. This is when you and your partner are fully remote but sharing a screen. It's good to become familiar with this type of pairing as you'll need to utilize it with mentors or on the job. You'll want to make sure you have a good internet connection and a working pair of headphones with microphone. Some good software tools to use are Slack -- it's integrated with a screen-sharing feature now that Slack has fully integrated Screenhero features; you can also use Google Hangouts or Zoom."** Cold Call on a student: **"What are potential pitfalls when using remote pairing?"** Potential answers: not having clear expectations on who is doing what while you're sharing the screen and looking at the same code, technical issues on either side, etc. Say: **"Now that we know what pairing can look like, let's discuss how to set expectations with each other..."**                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students listen, take notes, participate when called on                                              |
| Discuss DTR & DTR Memo (5 mins)                | Facilitator switches to slide 9 and says: **"Before you ever start looking at the spec and putting any code on the screen, you need to start your paired project with a DTR, which stands for Define the Relationship. What this means is having a conversation to set expectations with each other."** Walk through the guidelines document found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md) and say: **"These are suggested questions to ask each other and as you scroll down, you'll see the template for the DTR Memo. This is so you can keep a written record of the expectations you set, which is a helpful way to hold each other accountable during the project."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Students access link and ask questions if needed                                                     |
| Students define own expectations (5 mins)      | Facilitator switches to slide 10 and says: **"Start by defining your own expectations so that you have them in mind when you sit down with your partner. This slide shows you some suggested questions to think about. You should consider your strengths, both technical and non-technical, and as we talked about in the Gear Up earlier this week on working styles, remember what you need others to know about how you work your best. Think about how you want to communicate and your comfort level with Git workflow. Also, think about how you can work with someone who is very different from you. If you and your partner have different personalities or you think 'I don't really like this person,' that is not a reason that your pairing can't be successful. We don't have to be best friends with each other, but we can find ways to respectfully work with each other. Take 5 minutes to write out your expectations in your journal."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students write their expectations out quietly in their journals.                                     |
| Compromising with expectations (5 mins)        | Facilitator switches to slide 11 and says: **"How many people identify as early birds -- you do your best work in the morning and prefer to start work early?"** (Students raise hands). **"Now how many people identify as night owls? You prefer to work later at night"** (Students raise hands). **"Now let's say the early birds are paired up with the night owls. How can they work together effectively?"** Call on students; possible answers include: *divvy up the work for ping pong pairing during preferred work times and decide on times to come back together to debrief the work, etc.* Then say, **"Successful pairs rely on compromise. Remember lessons from Improv -- *'No'* means that you’re pushing your own agenda; *'Yes'* means that you’re expecting your partner to do all the work of defining expectations (even if you don’t agree with these expectations), but *'Yes and'* means that you’re collaborating and building on each other’s ideas for the good of the group. Also, beware of the Paired Project Fallacy, in which you might think to yourself 'My partner is better than I am' OR 'My partner is holding me back.' Why is this a fallacy? This is a fallacy because it discounts all the important skills you both bring to your partnership. If you don’t feel as strong in your technical skills, what are your other strengths? How do your strengths balance out your partner’s? How can you contribute to the project management? What do you want to learn during this project to improve your technical skills? If you feel like you have stronger technical skills, teaching your partner will help you solidify these skills. Alternatively, what can you learn from your partner? Beware of the 'Developer's Ego' -- learning to ask questions is an important skill for the workplace. Bottom line: Paired project code is owned by the entire team. There is no room (and no time, considering your tight deadlines) for egos -- you are here to support each other."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students raise hands and offer suggestions                                                           |
| Holding Each Other Accountable (5 mins)        | Facilitator switches to slide 12 and says: **"To hold each other accountable, reminder to take a memo of your DTR to have a record of what you discussed to reference as the project goes on. Make it into a gist so that everyone from the group has it. You can also utilize a Stand Up in which you'll start each work session discussing what you are each working on that day and what goals you hope to accomplish at the end of the work session. You should also utilize retros in which you'll hold end-of-day discussions on what’s going well, what’s not going well, and what you should change as a group to make your project and team more successful. And in longer projects, you should consider re-DTRing to review and readjust expectations midway through the project."** Note: if there is time (there often isn't), you can solicit answers from students on how these different strategies should look in practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students listen; if time, they provide ideas for what norms should be set in these conversations     |
| How to Address Broken Expectations I (5 mins)  | Facilitator switches to slide 13 and says: **"Let's talk about what happens when people break our expectations, starting with a scenario. Let's say you asked your very close and reliable friend to pick you up from the airport at a certain time. However, it's been 20 minutes and they aren't there. You need to get to work. What are you thinking right now?"** Solicit answers from students, and the answers should be something along the lines of *feeling worried, wondering what could have happened to the friend.* Now say: **"Ok, let's say actually this friend has been flaky before. Sometimes they don't show up when they say they will or don't text back. What are you thinking now?"** Solicit answers from the students who should say something like *feeling annoyed at the friend; wondering why they expected the friend to be reliable.* Say: **"Ok, now the friend shows up and says 'I'm so sorry, I had to take my dog to the vet, and then there was traffic, and my mom called, sorry I'm late!' And you say, 'it's fine.' What have you just done?"** Solicit answers from students, who will probably say something along the lines of *you've enabled your friend to do the behavior again; you haven't been honest with them.* Now say: **"You've just reacted with *silence.* Maybe you've reacted with sarcasm, maybe you're being passive aggressive, but you haven't addressed the issue, and you've given permission for this person to do this again. Now, let's say you get into the car, listen to your friend's excuses, and you blow up at them, yelling about how they're a bad friend and you don't want to deal with this anymore. What have you just done?"** Listen to student responses around how you acted aggressively. Now say: **"You've just reacted with violence. This is when you react aggressively, raising your voice, saying things you might not mean, and hurting the relationship as a result. You still haven't solved the problem at hand though."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students respond when prompted                                                                       |
| How to Address Broken Expectations I (5 mins)  | Facilitator switches to slide 14 and says: **"When a partner is not following through on expectations, the first step is to work on yourself: How are you reacting? If you're reacting with silence or violence, you're not addressing the problem. You should also be aware of the Fundamental Attribution Error. This error comes from an assumption that others are doing contrary things because it’s part of their makeup or that they don’t care rather than considering other potential motivational forces. This is when we switch from thinking our friend had some outside circumstances affect their ability to pick you up to thinking it was a character flaw."** Switch to slide 15 and say: **"You fix your reactions by first humanizing the situation and look at these 6 Sources of Influence to explain why someone might have broken expectations. These come down to either Motivation or Ability, and they're broken down by Personal, Social, and Structural influences."** Walk through the chart on the slide and say: **"Start with *personal motivation* -- does the person want/not want to do this? Then move to *personal ability* -- does the person have the ability to do this or not? Next is *social motivation,* which can sometimes look like peer pressure -- from teammates, instructors, etc. Think about *social ability* -- what help does your partner need from others? Think about how you’re contributing to the social aspect as well: pay attention to your own body language, tone of voice, etc. to think about if you're helping provide social motivation and ability or not. Then, lastly, consider *structural motivation,* which at Turing looks like deadlines and grades and can either be motivating or demotivating for different people. Consider *structural ability* -- is there anything structurally holding you back? Do you need a better organizational system, like using Trello, waffle.io, etc."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students listen, take notes                                                                          |
| How to Address Broken Expectations II (5 mins) | Facilitator switches to slide 16 and says: **"Now that you’ve identified a source of influence behind your partner’s behavior, how do you conduct a conversation to change that behavior? Start by *establishing safety:* you’re about to address something sensitive with another person and they may feel threatened in one way or another. Establish *mutual respect:* people feel unsafe when they don’t feel mutual respect, so make sure to show respect through a calm tone of voice, facial expressions, and using respectful language. Ask for permission to speak with your partner and make sure to speak in private. Establish a *mutual purpose* for the discussion: people feel unsafe when they don't understand the purpose behind the discussion and will instead invent stories about why you're attacking them. To keep that from happening, phrase your conversation around the goals of the project. You want to get the project back on track, not change who your partner is. Start the conversation by using *contrasting,* which looks like a "don't/do" statement to clarify what you mean. For example, you could say something like 'I *don’t* want you to think that I don’t value your ideas. You’ve contributed a lot of great ideas to the project. I *do* want to talk about how we could discuss ideas as a group before making a decision.' Then, describe what's happened by starting with *facts.* What did you observe to happen? Be careful of NOT inserting your opinion of what happened. In this example, you might say something like 'we agreed that we would make big decisions together, but during the check-in, you told our instructor that you had already decided to implement that new feature before you discussed it with me.' Next, describe how the incident made you *feel:* 'When you said that, it made me feel frustrated because I didn't think you valued my input and you weren’t taking our expectations seriously.' Finally, *ask* for the other person’s side because you are opening up a dialogue now: 'What is your take on this?'"** Facilitator switches to slide 17 and says: **"Listen to what they say and analyze the response according to the 6 sources of influence: is the problem due to motivation or ability? Discuss consequences related to your mutual purpose. For example: 'If we don’t make decisions together, our project will suffer.' Discuss new expectations if the issue is motivation: 'It sounds like you made that the decision because you felt pressure from the instructor to have a new idea in place at the check-in. Let’s redefine our goals for each check-in so that we're on the same page.' Discuss finding resources if the issue is ability: 'You made the decision because you couldn’t reach me. Let’s find 3 mutual times we can check in throughout the day.' Create action steps and re-DTR to decide who will do what and when."** Facilitator should pause here for questions before going on to practice.  | Students listen, take notes, ask questions                                                           |
| Student Practice & Share-Out (10 mins)         | Using Slide 19, say: **"Now you'll practice these principles using this scenario."** Read the scenario aloud off of the slide. Say: **"Get into pairs and decide who will play Partner A and Partner B. You can make up any details necessary for the scenario. As you decide on how to have the conversation, answer these questions: what assumptions need to be addressed? How will you conduct the conversation?"** Instruct students to find their partners and get started on the scenario. Move around the room as needed to help students follow the directions. After students have completed the practice, debrief as a whole group by cold calling on a few groups to describe what they talked about. Discuss if their partner's issue came down to motivation or ability and what they would do next.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Students decide who is playing which role in the scenario and facilitate the conversation in pairs.  |
