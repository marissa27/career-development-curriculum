#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we'll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. A long, long time from now, when you are ready to graduate, you will give a lightning talk about your experiences at Turing. Today we are going to start that lightning talk by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    youâ€™ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning middle and end.

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

We'll start building our stories by connecting with ourselves through these 3 questions to describe:
* Our backstories
* Our current struggles and successes -- *a turning point*
* Our futures

### Backstories: Who Are You?  
Where have you come from? What lenses do you view the world through? We'll answer these questions through life maps.

**I Do:** Facilitator shows off their life map to demonstrate how to outline one's backstory. Note: this is an opportunity to share information about your backstory and how your highs and lows have shaped your pathway here.

**You Do:** Students spend 10 minutes creating their life maps using the paper and markers provided. 

### Current Struggles and Successes: Why Are You Here?
In this stage of storytelling, let's examine our struggles, our identifying characteristics, and our successes. 

Another rule from Emma Coats states:

    You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

This is because we root for a character to overcome struggles and adversity. As the character in our own stories, we need to be able to access our vulnerabilities to authentically tell this part of our story -- *and our listeners will thank us for it because this is how they relate to us.* 

Let's here from some Turing staff on this aspect of their stories:

* Jeff's story of struggle:
      
      I remember really struggling when I first started learning about functional programming. At that point I had been 
      writing code for 15 years. I started to see that the anxiety about not "getting it" was actually preventing me from 
      getting it. When I don't understand what I'm doing I like to copy, modify, create. I take something that I know works, 
      from the web or a book or whatever, and just type that out and make it run. Then I start tweaking things. What if I 
      rearrange two lines, change some numbers or values, that kind of thing. I think of it as "pulling on" the code, seeing 
      how it flexes and changes. Then I delete a chunk of the code and try to write it myself.
   * What is the challenge here?
   * How did he overcome it?
   * How does this help you understand Jeff more?

* Victoria's description of her journey:
    
      I view the world through the lens of growing up in a lower-middle-class children-of-immigrants family (my parents' 
      parents' all fled Lithuania during World War II). Sometimes my parents would speak Lithuanian to keep us from hearing &
      I rarely spoke with my grandparents because they spoke mostly Lithuanian. My father's company was based in Lithuania and
      they got repeatedly downsized until it was only that branch left & he chose to move back there around 1990 and has lived
      in Vilnius ever since. My siblings and I grew up fairly religious and all that history, combined with my natural
      inclination to be introverted, made me very quiet, reserved and well-behaved kid. When I grew to understand many things
      that upset me about my religion and religion in general, I began to question everything and this sparked a highly
      curious and fairly rebellious stage of my life. I explored many different realms of work and various passions, and
      especially loved to challenge norms by taking on roles normally held by males. That led to being a nomadic farmer and
      cab driver for 5 years. The farming work-trades, apprenticeships, & jobs were the most unique and eye-opening
      experiences of my life, but ironically none of it was financially sustainable for me in the long-run. The cab life also
      became draining, risky, and isolating. So I decided I wanted a decent day job that could offer me a means to pay off my
      debts and eventually sponsor interesting opportunities for friends and loved ones. I really hope to eventually implement
      my newly-gained developer skills in tools for farmers, games for scientific education and resources to enhance political
      memory.
   * How would you describe Victoria as a character in this story? How do you know?
   * What character arc is developing here?
   * How does this help you understand Victoria more?

In order to tell the arc of our characterization at Turing, we need to be able to also own what we're good at and the successes that we have. One of the best ways to do that is to recognize our strengths, and luckily, StrengthsFinder has done some of that work for us. Now we need to actually own those strengths in action. 

**I Do:** Facilitator models a reflection on one of their StrengthsFinder strengths to discuss how it's helped them overcome a challenge.

**You Do:** Spend 5 minutes answering these questions that are part of your deliverable reflection:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

### Future Vision: What's Next?
Think back to why you applied to Turing; what dreams do you envision for yourself? Where does your Turing story end?

Solicit responses from 3-4 people.

Let's make these dreams a reality by creating a vision statement. This statement should utilize the first person ("I will...") and include concrete details to fully express where you want to go. 

**You Do:** Students spend 6 minutes writing or drawing out a vision statement. 

### Small Group Share

Students will get into groups of 4 to share as much as their comfortable from each section of their personal stories. Each group member should get 5 minutes to share, and then as a group, answer this question:

* By sharing our stories with one another, how can we as a community build on our similarities and learn from our differences?

Be prepared to share your answer with the whole group. 

### Closing: Whole Group Takeaways
1-3 groups' presenters share their groups discussion on the above question as well as these takeways:

* What are particularly easy or difficult about sharing your stories with each other?
* How can talking about these 3 areas (who are we, why are we here, what's next) help us in our future careers? 

#### Next Steps
It's important to remember that each of these pieces of your story is a draft. You're continuing to grow and learn, and thus your story will change. But this is about starting with our first draft and getting better at refining it as we go through the program. 

**Right Now:** Finish your [reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_storytelling_reflection.md) using what you worked on in this session for your deliverable due Monday of Week 6. 

**Looking Ahead:** 
* Module Two: Dive more deeply into your *professional* story
* Module Three: Tell your story through resumes, cover letters, and the Turing portfolio
* Module Four: Tell your Turing story through end-of-module lightning talks; On graduation day, cohorts have the opportunity to share their reflections on their time here.  Over and over again, students comment that they wish they had shared more of their stories sooner, that they wish they had spent more time understanding each other and what experiences brought each person here. Consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks. The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
