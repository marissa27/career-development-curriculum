### Opening

#### Hook: Storytelling Follow-Up
Last week, we spent time talking about our stories in terms of our identities, values, and strengths. Today, we'll practice storytelling in other contexts to dive into our developer identity.

**Pair & Share #1:** Find a partner for a 2-minute conversation. You'll describe yourself as a worker -- who are you as a worker?

**Pair & Share #2:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. Now describe yourself in regards to your previous job and why you're transitioning careers -- who are you as a career changer?

**Pair & Share #3:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. This time describe yourself as a developer -- who are you as a developer? What kind of developer do you see yourself as?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* Which details stayed consistent across your different stories?
* Which details were different?
* What was relatively easy or difficult about this exercise?

Personal branding is all about telling a consistent story about yourself, building out the details of this story with each profile. As you start this new career, telling your story as a new member of the software industry in as many consistent ways as possible will help you stand out and embrace that identity even more. 

Today, we'll look at a few tools you should use to define and build your personal brand. 

### LinkedIn
If you don't already have a LinkedIn profile, now is time to set one up [here](https://www.linkedin.com/). As we look at LinkedIn today, we'll talk about how you can passively use it for your job search -- how do people find you? How do they know who you are? It all has to do with how you tell your stories and the particular keywords that you're using.

#### Dissecting the Profile:
**Headline:** 

* This is what you want to be known for. What do you want your brand to be? What keywords do you want to be associated with? When recruiters do a search, what words do you want to lead to you? Use what you do to brand yourself
	* ...which is not necessarily the same as your working title although it can be
	* Consider "Software Developer Student," "Back End Engineering Student," or "Front End Engineering Student"
	* You can combine your past experiences with new skills like "Software Developer \| Former Educator"
	* Examples:
		* [Allison Reu Singer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonreusinger/)

**First Look:**
When a recruiter or potential employer clicks on your profile, they see 4 initial things:

* **Your picture:** Headshot of just you and the same photo across your multiple profiles
* **Your title:** See above
* **Your location:** Where do you want to be? If you want to work in San Francisco, list San Francisco
* **The first few sentences of your summary:** This is why it's so important. Make those first 100 words stand out. 

**Summary:** 
This is the story that you're telling: who you are (as a developer, worker, teammate, individual, etc.), how you got here (why software development, why now), what's next (what are your longterm career goals/ambitions). Your story is one of the few places in the profile where you can introduce yourself as a whole person. Your story should be told from a high level

Tips for an effective summary:

* Keep it to short paragraphs, 2-3 sentences per paragraph
* Write it in first person
* Provide a call to action -- what do you want people to do when they see your profile? Do you want them to look at your code, website, email you? 
	* Put your email address right there in the summary. Once you get a job, you can take it out, but don't create any blockers right now
	
**Work Experience:** 
As you list your past experiences, your accompanying description should not be bullet points. Why? It doesn't read as well on LinkedIn and interferes with keyword searches. LinkedIn is also built out to be a *storytelling platform*, so use it that way. Write in complete sentences and paragraphs. Think about how you read across a computer screen. You want your profile to be easy to scan since recruiters only have so much time to look at them

These descriptions should be:

* Short
* Value-driven rather than task-driven. What value did you bring to this company? Tasks don't matter as much to recruiters or employers looking at your profile
* Linked to the name of the company. 
	* You should list Turing under experience but clearly state that you're a student at Turing because you don't want to mislead anyone as this could lead to being dismissed from an interview process. Edit your title to "Software Developer Student," "Back End Engineering Student," or "Front End Engineering Student"
	* Describe your experience while at Turing -- what technologies are you learning?

**Education:**
Under education, make sure to include Turing again as this ties you to the [Turing alumni page](https://www.linkedin.com/school/3805597/alumni), which allows our Turing network to grow so that future students can seek out where alumni work just like you are

**Unique URL:**
Edit your URL with your name. Use just your first and last name, no numbers -- you don't want to open yourself up to any age discrimination.

To edit your URL, click on "edit your public profile" on the righthand side of the screen. From there, you'll see an edit button for your URL.

If your name is taken, use your middle name, etc. but it should be consistent across all social platforms. This is also easy to put on business cards.

**Nice to haves:** *Don't spend a ton of time on these extras, but consider how they may add to your profile.*

* Projects: any visuals are helpful. Recruiters aren't going to see this on their first look. They will see it on their second sweep
* Skills: list all the technologies you use even if you haven't been endorsed for them, but they should be in the lower part
* You can make your LinkedIn in multiple languages to address and attract different communities. This is effective if you'd like to work abroad

#### Add Connections
Start with a network of at least 50 connections (but always aim for 500+ quality connections). Don't forget to add Turing staff:

* Engage with your connections by liking, commenting on, and/or sharing their updates.
* As you continue to grow in your development at Turing, share your own updates, whether they be blog posts or links to projects.

### Twitter Overview
- Display your brand visually and through written content
- Engage in conversations that reinforce your personal brand

#### Profile: Looking Good
- Include a headshot of **_you_**
- Include your personal website link, email, and mini, high-level bio introduction
- Consider what your profile says about you to someone that has never met you

#### Converse
- Search for topics interesting to you ("webdev", "edtech", "diversity in tech")
- Consider how you would approach a conversation at a party. Listen, observe, then evaluate when is appropriate to interject with your opinion, perspective, knowledge.
- Add to the conversation

### GitHub Overview
- Add a headshot photo rather than using the avatar - CTOs will think you're an amateur otherwise
- Complete GitHub profile with:
	- Name
	- Location
	- Link to personal site once you have one
	- Twitter handle

#### Complete Profile
- Share your email address, personal website, location, headshot
- Never block someone from connecting with you while you are job searching -- the more information the better

### Stack Overflow
Same rules:

* Use the same photo
* Tell your story
* Include links to your Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn
* Location

### What's Coming Next
In Module 3, we'll work on:

* Resumes
* Turing portfolio

By that time in the program, you'll have more to add to your professional expertise, but the foundation that we set through LinkedIn and other branding tools will make creating these easier and more streamlined.
