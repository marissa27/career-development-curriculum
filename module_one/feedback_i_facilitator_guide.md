| Timing | Facilitator Talking Points | Participant Actions |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------|
| 4 minutes | Introduce the session with the objectives on Slide 4. Then, on slide 5, discuss why we're talking about feedback. Read the reasons off of the the slide, and solicit 1-2 additional reasons from students on the importance of feedback in the workplace | Whole Group Discussion |
| 6 minutes | Read the directions on Slide 7 about the Personal Reflection that students will write. Mention that this could be feedback from anyone in their lives -- work groups, spouses/partners, family members, etc. As they start writing, circulate the room to ensure that everyone is on task |  Students should write in their notebooks if they have them; if not, they can create a gist |
| 5 minutes | Direct students to do a Turn and Talk to discuss their reflections on feedback with a partner. If needed, there can be groups of 3. Circulate the room while students discuss. | Paired discussion |
| 2 minutes | On Slide 8, review the 3 triggers to feedback by soliciting answers for what each trigger means and when people might experience them by cold calling on students. For your reference: truth triggers occur when you feel that the feedback is unhelpful or somehow untrue; relationship triggers are related to the particular person giving the feedback and what your relationship is with them; identity triggers are about us and how the feedback might make us feel unsure about ourselves | Students provide answers when called on |
| 5 minutes | (Slides 9-12) Say: **"In order to better understand our triggers, we need to understand the kinds of feedback we're receiving."** Talk through the 3 different kinds of feedback: **Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation.** Switch to slide 10 and Say: **" Appreciation is giving thanks to your partner and encouraging your partner to keep doing what they're doing well. For this to be effective, the appreciation needs to be specific, authentic, and delivered in a form that works for you -- you want to be true to yourself when delivering this feedback. This feedback is very important and shouldn't be discounted -- often we think of feedback as only constructive, but we also need to provide recognition for what's going well. **Coaching is discussing a better way to do something in order to help your partner grow."** Switch to slide 11 and say: **"Coaching can be related to improving your skills or fixing a perceived imbalance in a relationship. To be effective, coaching is about listening to what your partner would really benefit from and asking questions of them. Coaching also needs to be very specific."** Switch to slide 12 and say: **"Evaluation is telling your partner where they stand compared to a set of standards. Evaluation aligns expectations and clarifies consequences. This is the kind of feedback you receive from your instructors as they compare your work to their rubrics. To be effective, you need to have clear standards and expectations to evaluate against. During this feedback cycle, you'll be giving appreciation and coaching to your partners but not evaluation; since this is your first time working with them, you don't have any comparisons to provide."** | Students listen and take notes as needed |
| 8 mins | Using Slide 13, go through each example feedback and cold call on a student to say which kind of feedback it is and how they know. Answers: 1. Appreciation 2. Coaching 3. Appreciation + Evaluation. For each example, ask students to describe what they think of the feedback and say: **"Is this feedback helpful? Would you feel triggered at all? Why?"** and call on various students who volunteer their answers. |  Whole Group Discussion; students answer as called on and other students also provide answers as needed |
| 8 mins | Using Slide 14, say: **"This brings us to intent and impact. Every dialogue includes intent and impact. The intent is the purpose behind the giver's message, but it may not always align with the impact it has on the receiver, which is how they are affected by the message. The way we are impacted by feedback can correspond with one of the three triggers. Let's look at this example."** Walk through the example on the slide and ask students, **"What kind of feedback is this? How does the impact here relate to a trigger? How could this language be reframed to be more aligned with the intent?"** Cold call or call on volunteers. Then switch to slide 15 and say: **"Blind spots are always present in our communication as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include your facial expressions, your tone of voice, and your behavior patterns."** Ask students: **"What blind spots should we be aware of when we're providing written feedback?"** Cold call on students if they don't volunteer. Possible answers: *lack of hearing tone of voice, misunderstandings or too general of feedback, etc.* Say: **"It's important to remember how much of written feedback can be left up to interpretation and so we need to spend more time making sure it has the exact details needed to be aligned with our intent as much as possible."** Switch to slide 16 and say: **"Blind Spots can also lead to Biases. A bias is a feeling either favorable or negative towards others based on a narrowed viewpoint. We often feel positive bias towards others who are most like us and negative bias against others who are different from us, so we may be more likely to not give constructive feedback to people who are similar to us or we may be overly critical of people towards whom we have a negative bias. This is the same with how we receive feedback -- we might be less likely to take feedback from people we hold a negative bias towards while we consider feedback from those we have a positive bias towards as more valuable."** Switch to slide 17 and say: **"Finally, the 3 important guiding principles for crafting your feedback comes down to being *specific, actionable,* and *kind.*"** | Students take notes |
| 10 mins | Using slide 18, direct students to get into pairs for a Turn & Talk to discuss the 2 examples on the slide. They should discuss what kind of feedback it is, what is missing or incomplete from the feedback, and how they might rephrase the feedback to make the impact more aligned with the intent. Students should discuss with their partners for about 6 minutes, and then provide some time for debrief. Cold call on 2 different groups to discuss the two scenarios. | Students discuss the feedback with their partners and then provide answers for the whole group discussion |
| 5 mins | Using slide 20, read through the example feedback and solicit answers from students on what is working in the feedback and what could be triggering and therefore needs to be reworded. | Whole Group Discussion |
| 5 mins | *If there's time left:* using slide 21, have students start to think about the feedback they will give their partner and instruct them to get started on drafting out both appreciation and coaching. | Students write silently in their journals |

After the session wraps, send out a survey to collect their feedback. Refer to Allison's maternity leave plan for directions on this.
