### Logistics

| Set Up | Materials Needed | PPT Link (if PPT)|
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| How should the room be set up? What AV is needed? | Students should have journals, something to write with, and their laptops. Your laptop is needed to present slides. | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lYiWl7gyoViF-ln4m_LY-Jx8wFcRAvJ428ivR8MU0sc/edit?usp=sharing) |

### Session Structure

* [Student Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_one/intro_strengthsfinder_session.md)

* Students will create gists for their reflections using this [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md). **Note:** they should NOT edit the template itself. Repeating students have specific questions to answer midway down the template. 

Length: 60 minutes
 
* Opening (5 mins)
* Overview: what is a strength, etc. (10 mins)
* I Do: Demonstrate how to interpret reports (10 mins)
* We Do: Get to know each other through strengths (15 mins)
* You Do: Individual Reflections (18 mins)
* Closing: Recap use of StrengthsFinder and option for coaching (2 mins)

### Before the Session
* Review your strengths and reports before the session to be ready to share them with the class. You'll want to update Slide 12 with your own strengths. 
* You'll also want to update Slide 22 with guidelines for how Ellen Mary would like to run coaching/support sessions with students.
* Create a spreadsheet by making a copy of [this one](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/spreadsheets/d/1sTqhaRG-25nTau3gqkSPHZ9YQkfBejCEXyNgyEylXK4/edit?usp=sharing) and adding in the roster for the cohort to use in the session.

| Opening (5 mins)                                   | Using Slides 3-4, read through the objectives and the first step of the StrengthsFinder discovery process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Students follow along, take notes if needed                     |
| Overview (10 mins)                                 | Using Slides 6-10, say: **"What do we mean by strengths? Strengths come from the development of skills, knowledge, and talents."** Read through the rest of the slides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Students follow along, ask questions if needed                  |
| Demonstrate Strengths Reflections (10 mins)        | Using Slides 11-17, discuss the 3 different StrengthsFinder reports that students will have received, and demonstrate how you'd reflect on 1 of your strengths -- mention that they should reflect on all 5 but for the sake of time, you'll only reflect on 1. You'll want to discuss scenarios from your own work in which you've seen yourself both using and overusing your particular strength. Pick out an action step from the reports that you'd use to further develop your strength. Pause for questions.                                                                                                                                                  | Students follow along and ask questions if needed               |
| Get to Know Each Other Through Strengths (15 mins) | Using Slide 19, instruct students to spend 5 minutes reflecting on the definitions of their top 5 themes and answering the first 3 questions from the template. Post the spreadsheet for their cohort in their Slack channel so that they can fill it out and understand each other's strengths more. After 5 minutes, switch to Slide 20 and say: **"Now we'll do 3 rounds of speed dating to get to know each other by introducing ourselves using our top 5 StrengthsFinder themes."** Tell students to find a partner and use the questions on the slide to direct their conversations. Give students 3 minutes per partnership and then to find a new partner.  | Students reflect independently, then participate in discussions |
| Further Reflections (18 mins)                      | Using Slide 21, direct students to continue using the template to answer questions, reflect on their StrengthsFinder results, and create short-term and longterm professional goals. Students are given 18 minutes so that they have plenty of time to reflect; if students finish early, it's fine to finish early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students reflect independently                                  |
| Closing (2 mins)                                   | Using Slide 22, let students know that they can meet with Ellen Mary to discuss their results further if they'd like to have extra support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students finish up their reflections                            |
