| Opening (15 mins)                             | Using Slide 3, introduce the objectives for the session. Say: **"The tools we discuss today can help you in your future careers moves, but today, we'll be talking about negotiations specifically for how you can navigate this process during your first job search as a developer."** Switch to Slide 4 and instruct students to reflect on the statements from the slide in their journals. Provide students with 4-5 minutes for their reflection. After they finish, switch to Slide 5 and say: **"We'll come back to those questions later, but now turn and talk to the person next to you about the big question -- if you were in an interview and you were asked 'what are your salary expectations?' how would you answer that question?"** Provide students with 5 minutes for their turn and talk. After that time, cold call on 2-3 students to gauge how they would respond to that question. You'll likely receive a variety of responses, ranging from students who provide a specific number to students who have no idea what to say. Say: **"We'll come back to this question in a second, but first, let's understand our feelings about negotiations and what motivations we might have to answer that question."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Students write in their journals, participate in discussions |
| Unpacking the Conversation (15 mins)          | Using Slide 7, say: **"A negotiation conversation could take as little as 5 minutes. Think about that. You generally can’t do 5 minutes of work this year and have your boss give you an extra $10,000. But you can pick up $10,000 in salary negotiations just by having a conversation about your compensation. That makes your negotiation five very important minutes so that no money is left on the table. You can't afford to *not* negotiate. Furthermore, the wage gap in tech is very real, and the only way we can start to even the playing field is to create transparency around salaries. That starts with negotiations. Bottom line: do not let money stay on the table that could be yours."** Switch to Slide 8 and say: **"As a society, we're not very comfortable talking about money. It can bring up a lot of different emotions for us, but unpacking how we feel about these things leads to empowerment in negotiations. Go back to those questions you answered at the beginning of the session today. Turn & Talk to the same person you spoke with earlier to discuss your answers."** Provide students with 5 minutes for their turn and talk; then cold call on 2-3 people to share out their takeaways and how they feel about each of the words from earlier. You'll mostly likely hear students say that the word "negotiations" makes them think of a partnership, a compromise, etc. Say: **"Yes, a negotiation is meant to be a conversation that creates an equal playing field, and again, it allows you to participate in the decision for your compensation. Successful people negotiate."** Switch to Slide 9 and say: **"Now that we have a better understanding of the kind of conversation a negotiation can be, let's go back to this question -- what are your salary expectations?"** Switch to Slide 10 and say: **"For your first developer job, I recommend that you use a phrase like this to answer that question. Never put down a number first. Why? You lock yourself into a number, and the conversation ends there. You can't negotiate any longer. You may hear different advice from other staff members, but I recommend this answer for two reasons. One, this provides you with some practice negotiating and again, you can't do that if you provide a number or even a range of numbers -- employers will most likely go for your lowest number in your range, which still stops the conversation. You won't be able to create that transparency without continuing the conversation. But the second reason is that this allows you to advocate for yourself in your first job and set a precedent for negotiations in later jobs. And remember, we're facing a wage gap, so I really recommend this answer for women and minorities in tech."** Students may have questions about this answer. Also say: **"During this discussion, you may be talking with a hiring manager. Don’t be offended if they ask you again -- they are just doing what they've been told, and they might not be equipped to go through a negotiation at the time. You should still push back about wanting to know more about what is being offered. If you're filling out an online form, and it expects an answer, it's fine to write in 0 or $1 and mention that you want to have an in-person discussion -- as all salary discussions should be."** | Students participate in discussion                           |
| Discussion: Receiving an Offer (15 mins)      | Switch to Slide 11 and say: **"Congrats! After you asked for more information, you received an offer! For the sake of today's example, we're going to say you received this offer in Denver."** Read the example off of the slide and ask students to reflect on the offer independently. Say: **"What do you need to consider from this offer? What pros and cons come to mind? What questions do you have? Do you feel like you have enough information or is anything missing? How would you counter based on your reflections?"** Provide students with 5 minutes to reflect in their journals on this offer. Then switch to slide 12 and read through the points of what students should do after they receive the offer. *This isn't on the slide but should also be said:* **"You may not always have the luxury of a lot of time. If someone says, 'I need to know an answer in 48 hours,' you should still get as much information as you can, but you might not be able to. In this case, create a pro and con list -- to decide which offer you’ll take. It’s not a red flag that they need you to hurry necessarily -- maybe they just got a bigger workload and need to make a hiring decision quickly. Think about it as a whole -- what were your interactions like at the company? What are the relationships with the team members? You can still talk to your other companies and say something like, 'I found out I need to let them know by this time, is there a way I could know about your hiring deadline by then? I’m still really interested.'"** Switch to slide 13 and read through the points, and then switch to Slide 14, read through the points and pause on the statement, "I'm excited about this offer. I was hoping to make X. How can we close the gap on this?" Ask students: **"What do you notice about this statement?"** Call on 2-3 students to get their input. You can follow that up with these ideas: **"Using 'we' shows that this is a joint effort; it's not an aggressive move as you're saying 'close the gap' instead of 'I need this.' Don't mention another company or their offer -- that becomes aggressive. The tech industry is small, and companies talk. Don't give them a bad impression; plus, you don't know what's happening behind the scenes."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students take notes and participate in discussion            |
| Pair Practice & Whole Group Debrief (10 mins) | Using Slide 15, have students pair up and practice negotiating based on their reflections on the offer. Switch to Slide 16 and using the whiteboard, call on students to discuss the parts of the offer that they've discussed. Some points you may want to bring up in case students don't bring them up are: **Unlimited PTO -- what does this mean in practice? "Benefits" -- what do these entail? What does parental leave look like? Mention that is even if this isn't something on students' radar, they should know what the policy is before accepting the offer in case this is something that they need later on. What parameters are there on the professional development stipend? What parameters are there on the transit stipend?** After discussing any additional points from students, switch to Slide 17 and 18 and discuss the points on the slides. Answer questions that students may have from these slides. Use Slide 20 to say: **"The bottom line is that you need to advocate for yourself because there's no guarantee that anyone else will."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students participate turn & talk and group discussion        |
