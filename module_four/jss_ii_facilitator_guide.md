| Opening (5 mins)                 | Using slide 3, say: **"You've reached the home stretch of your Turing experience. You've learned so much, and you've been putting a lot of important steps into place for your job search. Take time to celebrate that progress! And now as you near graduation, we'll create a final plan to help you get the job you deserve and want."** Move to slide 4 to discuss the objectives listed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students listen, take notes                                             |
| Argue your case (10-15 mins)     | Using slide 6, say: **"When we met in week 1, we discussed how often we can put barriers on our job searches by listening to the impostor syndrome voices in our heads instead of giving ourselves the credit we deserve. One of the most effective ways to help us move past barriers is to find a way to argue against them. Think about the day you decided to apply to Turing -- *what was your motivation then to start this career? What is your motivation now?* Use those ideas to fuel your argument against any thought that casts doubt on this job search."** Instruct students to outline an argument about why they deserve this new career using the questions on the slide. Students will have 10 minutes to write this argument. | Students craft their arguments quietly in journals or on their laptops. |
| Self-assessment Ratings (5 mins) | Using slide 7, say: **"It's time for a pulse check to assess how you're doing with the different areas that are covered in the 30-day plan."** Instruct students to look through the list on the slide and assign themselves ratings on a 1-5 scale (1 = not currently doing/not confident to complete, 5 = currently doing/very confident to complete). Instruct anyone who already has a job offer secured that they should rate themselves on section #2 on the plan template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students rate themselves in their journals or on laptops                |
| PD Group Discussion (10-15 mins) | Using slide 8, say: **"Now get into your PD peer groups and discuss where you feel strongest, where you feel weakest, and how you'll support each other in these last two weeks and especially during the first 30 days post-grad."** Students move into groups to discuss these questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Students discuss questions in their groups                              |
| Whole Group Share-Out (5 mins)   | Call on 2-3 groups to share out what specific things they'll support each other on in this next phase of the job search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students listen and participate in discussion                           |
| Plan Work Time (20-30 mins)      | Using slide 10, instruct students to start working on their [plans](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) and remind them that they'll need to bring a working version to their PD peer groups the next day and a completed draft is due at their portfolio reviews the following week. They should remember to keep assessing the feasibility of the plan during those first 30 days after graduation and make any adjustments needed to help it be effective for them. The session will wrap at 60 minutes, but students should use this time to work on their plans and ask any questions they have about the plans.                                                        | Students work on plans.                                                 |
