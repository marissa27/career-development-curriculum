### Session Structure

* Please post the [Student Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/pd_kickoff.md) in their cohort channels at the top of the session

Length: 60 minutes
 
* Opening: objectives, scope & sequence of M4 PD. Introduction to PD groups, breakdown of week by week, and discussion of 30-day plan (12 mins)
* Visioning, Barriers, & Strengths (20 mins)
* Choose Your Own Adventure: Resources (8 mins)
* Jobtrack set-up (18 mins)
* Closing & prepare to get into breakout groups (2 mins)

### Before the Session
* Have Jobtrack tutorial queued up for 1706 (not necessary for 1708)
* Update slide 20 with the new PD Peer Groups
* Decide on how to model the 5 strategies for overcoming barriers. This is a way that we as staff can share our stories with students and help them to make connections. Specifically, you'll need to model:
  * Imagining that you can't fail at the job search/have unlimited resources -- what would you try?
  * Discuss what you've done in the past to help you overcome barriers in your job search
  * Brainstorm a few options based on your StrengthsFinder strengths and [domains of leadership](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N449kYbcOhu22vbORfjUOfjFOIfPoka5w00q_fklipU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Name a worst-case scenario -- what's the worst thing that could happen? What would happen if you intentionally did the thing that you're afraid of?
  * Find the underlying motivation for embarking on a job search in a new field -- link it back to the practicalities (not just the dreams) of what this new career means, such as higher income, support family better, greater work-life balance, intellectual stimulation, ability to make a difference on a real scale, etc.

| Opening (10 mins)                                | Using Slides 3-5, read through the objectives and expectations for PD in Module 4. After discussing the deliverables, provide students with 3-5 minutes to read through the 30-day plan template (post this in their channels) and see if they have any questions. After answering questions for 2-3 minutes, move to slide 6 to introduce the concept of PD Peer Groups and discuss the expectations using [this doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md), which you should also post in their channels. Give students 2-3 minutes to look through those guidelines and again 2-3 minutes to ask any questions about the expectations of PD Peer Groups and the coaches. After you've covered how the module will be structured, move to the next discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Students follow along, read through plan when directed, take notes if needed                                                                                                              |
| Visioning, Barriers, & Strengths Intro (10 mins) | Using Slide 7, instruct students to close their eyes and imagine their dream jobs. Read the prompts off of the slides. Have students do this visioning exercise for 2 minutes. Then switch to Slide 8 to introduce the idea of barriers and say: **"Job searching can be uncomfortable and create a lot of insecurity. In fact, we can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance. When we do that, we create our own barriers to success."** Read through the examples on the slide, and discuss how you might move past each barrier -- for the first one, you might say: **"Often, job descriptions are written by hiring managers or someone else who doesn't actually know what the job needs. They might think writing 3-5 years' experience or CS degree will help them find the person who can do the job, but what we know is that if you can demonstrate that you can do the job well, you're a viable candidate. Apply to the job anyway and use the opportunity to show your projects."** For the second one, you can mention how **"there are many ways to network, such as blogging, engaging in social media, or make meetups less scary by attending with a friend and pre-planning 1-2 people you could speak with."** For the third one, discuss that **"there are many opportunities to practice interviewing this module through mock interviews with instructors, Jeff, and mentors."** And for the fourth one, reinforce the idea that structuring a job search according to your highest priorities will help you find what you want more quickly. You can also solicit responses from students on how they would move past a specific barrier. Then, using slides 9 and 10, have students reflect individually in their journals for 5-6 minutes on the barriers that may come up for them in their job search. They should be ready to share these with their PD Peer Groups later.  | Students participate with responses; students write in their journals.                                                                                                                    |
| 5 Strategies (15-20 mins)                        | Using Slides 11 - 15, discuss 5 strategies for students to overcome barriers. For each strategy, first model how you would think through the questions using examples from your own job searches, career transitions, or other applicable stories. Remember: it's important for students to hear *your* stories. Then provide students with 3 minutes or so to answer the questions on each slide in their journals before moving on to the next slide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Students follow along, write down their thoughts in their journals.                                                                                                                       |
| JobTrack setup (18 mins)                         | Using Slide 17, introduce Jobtrack.io and play video tutorial for students on the monitors. If students have an account but not with Turing, instruct them to DM Kayt to let her know that they need to be added to our account. Students with an account already can spend time updating their accounts or exploring the resources in the guidelines doc. **Note:** 1706 has heard of it but not everyone has signed up for it; If we extend our contract to a full account, 1708 will have all signed up for it, so this time can be used to start jumping into the resources in the [guidelines doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md); if we haven't extended our contract, then this time can be cut short for students to start meeting with their groups and coaches. You can also use time to answer questions before having them break out into their peer groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Students should watch the tutorial and set up their Jobtrack accounts. For students who already have Jobtrack set up, they should explore the resources in the peer group guidelines doc. |
| Break into groups (2 mins)                       | Using slide 19, remind students about the resources they have for their peer groups, and with slide 20, have them find their groups and begin introductions/DTR with each other. Remind them again of the guidelines for their groups (link is in slide 19 as well).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Students find their groups                                                                                                                                                                |
